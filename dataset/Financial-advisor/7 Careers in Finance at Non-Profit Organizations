Many financial professionals have discovered that working in the non-profit sector provides them with a measure of satisfaction and enjoyment that they didn’t get previously when they were working for just a paycheck. Although the pay is less, jobs tend to be more secure in this sector in the long run, and those who work in the higher echelons of larger firms can still earn a respectable salary.
 
While many salaries may be lower, the benefits at many non-profit entities can rival those of the best private sector firms. Workplace rules at non-profit entities are also often less stringent than in the corporate sector; employees may not be required to wear suits and ties every day or adhere to rigid schedules.
 
The non-profit sector offers a stable selection of jobs for those who seek other types of fulfillment from their jobs than just purely financial. Although these jobs don’t pay as much as those in corporate America, they do offer employees the chance to work for something they believe in and help their fellow citizens in various capacities.
