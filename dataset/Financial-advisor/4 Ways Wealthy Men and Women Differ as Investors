There are several key differences between how men and women invest, according to a new white paper published by Spectrem Group, High Net Worth Men vs. Women.﻿﻿ This paper examines the different approaches taken by each gender when it comes to handling money and investments.
 
The paper is based upon data culled from 1,875 high net worth males and 1,277 high net worth females across the U.S., and it uncovered four main differences between how men and women dealt with their assets. Read on for how they differ—the insights can shed some light on how financial advisors can target their services toward one gender vs. another.

When it comes to investments and money, men tend to take a more hands-on approach and are more likely to rely on themselves to get the job done. Women rely more on advisors and professional help for their needs and are more risk-averse than their male counterparts. Advisors who work with high net worth clients need to tailor their services accordingly in order to build stronger relationships and foster greater client loyalty.
