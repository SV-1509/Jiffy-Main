A zero-coupon certificate of deposit is a CD bought at a discounted rate. It differs from a traditional CD in that interest payments are paid out as a lump sum at the date of maturity, as opposed to being disbursed on an annual basis.
 
Zero-coupon CDs are a minimum-risk tool for investing and saving. They are generally a good fit for conservative, risk-averse investors for whom generating cash flow or ongoing income is not a priority.
 
A zero-coupon CD is a CD sold at a steep discount, which nevertheless pays out the full face value at maturity. Its name comes from the fact that it has no “coupon” or annual interest payment. This investment product is considered low risk—you invest your money and, provided you don't withdraw it early, your return is guaranteed over a certain time period. Although zero-coupon CDs are usually sold through brokerages, they can also be issued by banks, which means they are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as long as the bank is FDIC insured.
 A downside of zero-coupon CDs is that they are sometimes callable, which means the issuer can redeem them before their maturity date. 
There are positives and negatives to investing in zero-coupon CDs that buyers should keep in mind.
