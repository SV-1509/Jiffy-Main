The letter Q used to be part of the ticker symbol for a stock trading on the Nasdaq, specifying that a particular company was in bankruptcy proceedings. If the letter Q appeared as the final letter of a NASDAQ symbol, it meant, "bankrupt: issuer has filed for bankruptcy," as the Nasdaq put it.
 
The system changed in 2016 for using the letter Q. Nasdaq now uses the Financial Status Indicator, which marks key issues beyond just bankruptcy filings, including a failure to meet Nasdaq listing requirements. Other markets and exchanges may still use "Q" to indicate a bankruptcy filing, however.
 Q is one of two letters that the NASDAQ no longer uses as an identifier, with the other being E. 
Nasdaq-listed securities generally have four letters in their listings. The fifth letter is an identifier and there are a number of them. This includes the letter A, which denotes Class A shares, or W, which denotes warrants.
