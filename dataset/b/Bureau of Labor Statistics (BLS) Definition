The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a federal agency that produces a range of economic data about the U.S. economy. These reports include the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI), both important measures of inflation.
 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is an arm of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), and its primary purpose is to research, assemble, and publish a range of statistical data on the labor market, prices, and productivity. The statistics produced by the BLS are some of the most influential economic indicators for the American economy; they are frequently cited by the media and used by businesses, academics, and policymakers to inform their decisionmaking. 
 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics goes to great lengths to ensure accuracy, impartiality, and accessibility of their reports. The agency's data releases are closely watched by economists and market participants in order to generate better and more accurate predictions for how the economy and markets will perform in the future.
 
Some of the most important statistical releases published by the BLS include:
 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was established as a branch of the Department of the Interior in 1884 with a mandate to research and compile information about economics and labor. It was incorporated into the Department of Labor (DOL) in 1913. It is currently still a part of the DOL. Throughout its history, the BLS has been relied upon for empirical evidence to inform economic policy. For example, research from the BLS is often used to justify raising the minimum wage.
