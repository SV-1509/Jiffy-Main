The AER is the interest rate for a savings account or investment product that has more than one compounding period. That is, it's calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is included in the principal payment's balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance.
 
Overall, this means that interest can be compounded several times in a year depending on the number of times that interest payments are made.

To calculate AER:
 
The AER is displayed as a percentage (%).
 
The AER is the actual interest rate that an investor will earn for an investment, a loan, or another product based on compounding. The AER reveals to investors what they can expect to return from an investment, meaning the actual return of the investment based on compounding, which is more than the stated or nominal interest rate.
 
Assuming interest is calculated (or compounded) more than once a year, the AER will be higher than the stated interest rate. The more compounding periods, the greater the difference between the two will be. The annual equivalent rate (AER) is also known as effective annual interest rate or annual percentage yield (APY).
 The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interchangeable with the phrases "effective interest rate (EIR)" and "effective annual interest rate." 
Let's look at AER in both savings accounts and bonds.
 
Assume an investor wishes to sell all the securities in their investment portfolio and place all the proceeds in a savings account. The investor is deciding between placing the proceeds in Bank A, Bank B, or Bank C, depending on the highest rate offered. Bank A has a quoted interest rate of 3.7% that pays interest on an annual basis. Bank B has a quoted interest rate of 3.65% that pays interest quarterly, and Bank C has a quoted interest rate of 3.7% that pays interest semiannually.
