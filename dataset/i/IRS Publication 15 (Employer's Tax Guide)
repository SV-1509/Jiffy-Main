"IRS Publication 15: Employer's Tax Guide" is a document published by the Internal Revenue Service detailing an employer's responsibilities for filing and reporting tax information. The document covers the withholding, depositing, reporting, paying, and correcting of taxes for employees, not for the corporation itself. IRS Publication 15 provides the most up-to-date tax withholding tables for the current year. It is also referred to as Circular E.﻿﻿
 
IRS Publication 15 is used to determine federal income tax, not state or local taxes. The Tax Guide details federal income tax amounts for payroll withholdings, including Medicare and Social Security amounts.﻿﻿ Employers should refer to their state's tax rules to ensure that proper state income tax amounts are withheld from employees' paychecks. Extra tax information is also available in IRS Publication 15-A.﻿﻿
 
One of the most important features contained in the Employer’s Tax Guide is the Percentage Method Tables and Wage Bracket Method Tables for Income Tax Withholding.﻿﻿ Those wage bracket tables help an employer to know exactly which percentage of their employees’ payroll they should be withholding for taxes every pay period in order to comply with federal tax regulations. In order to determine the tax withholding amount, an employee must also file a W-4 Form, which can be updated as situations change in the employee’s life, such as a new family member.﻿﻿ In the event that an employee does not file a W-4, the Employer’s Tax Guide also details what amount to withhold instead.﻿﻿
