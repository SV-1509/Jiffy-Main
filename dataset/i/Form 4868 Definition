Form 4868: Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form for individuals who wish to extend the amount of time they have to file their tax returns. Any extension granted by the IRS applies only to paperwork.﻿﻿
 Filing Form 4868 does not alleviate the taxpayer of tax liability. All payments must be made by April 15 or interest will incur.﻿﻿ 
A U.S. citizen or resident who wants an automatic extension to file a U.S. individual income tax return should file this form. Taxpayers in the country receive a maximum six-month extension. U.S. citizens or residents who are out of the country on the due date are allowed two extra months without Form 4868 to file their returns and pay any amount due without requesting an extension. Filing this form will grant an additional four months to the taxpayer out of the country.﻿﻿ The IRS qualifies those out out the country as:
 
This short form should be completed with the individual or married couple's names, address, Social Security numbers, estimate of total tax liability for the year, total payments already made, remaining amount due, and amount being paid, if any.﻿﻿
 
The form should be filed by April 15.﻿﻿
