The International Labor Organization is a United Nations (UN) agency that aims to "promote decent work throughout the world."
 
The International Labor Organization's (ILO) was founded in 1919 and incorporated into the UN as a specialized agency in 1946. The organization's goal is to serve as a uniting force between governments, businesses, and workers. It emphasizes the need for workers to enjoy "conditions of freedom, equity, security, and human dignity" through their employment.
 
The ILO promotes international labor standards through its field offices in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia. The organization provides training on fair employment standards, provides technical cooperation for projects in partner countries, analyzes labor statistics and publishes related research, and regularly holds events and conferences to examine critical social and labor issues. The ILO was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1969.
