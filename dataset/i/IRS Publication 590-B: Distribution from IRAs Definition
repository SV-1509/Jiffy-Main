IRS Publication 590-B explains the tax implications of withdrawing money from any type of individual retirement account (IRA) before or after retirement. It specifies when you can't withdraw money without paying a penalty and when you must withdraw money.

However, a withdrawal for qualified higher education expenses or first-time home purchase is not subject to the penalty.
 
The IRS has numerous publications explaining the ins and outs of qualified retirement plans.
