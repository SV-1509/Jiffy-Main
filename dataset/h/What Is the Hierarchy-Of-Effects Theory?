The hierarchy-of-effects theory is a model of how advertising influences a consumer's decision to purchase or not purchase a product or service. The hierarchy represents the progression of learning and decision-making consumer experiences as a result of advertising. A hierarchy-of-effects model is used to set up a structured series of advertising message objectives for a particular product, to build upon each successive objective until a sale is ultimately made. The objectives of a campaign are (in order of delivery): awareness, knowledge, liking, preference, conviction, and purchase.
 
The hierarchy-of-effects theory is an advanced advertising strategy in that it approaches the sale of a good through well-developed, persuasive advertising messages designed to build brand awareness over time. While an immediate purchase would be preferred, companies using this strategy expect consumers to need a longer decision-making process. The goal of advertisers is to guide a potential customer through all six stages of the hierarchy.
 
The behaviors associated with the hierarchy-of-effects theory can be boiled down to "think," "feel," and "do," or cognitive, affective and conative behaviors. The hierarchy-of-effects model was created by Robert J. Lavidge and Gary A. Steiner in their 1961 article A Model for Predictive Measurements of Advertising Effectiveness.
