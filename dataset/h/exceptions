Holding period return is the total return received from holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a period of time, known as the holding period, generally expressed as a percentage. Holding period return is calculated on the basis of total returns from the asset or portfolio (income plus changes in value). It is particularly useful for comparing returns between investments held for different periods of time.
 
Holding Period Return (HPR) and annualized HPR for returns over multiple years can be calculated as follows:
 
﻿Holding Period Return\begin{aligned}&\textit{Holding Period Return}\\&\qquad=\frac{\textit{Income }+(\textit{End Of Period Value }-\textit{ Initial Value})}{\textit{Initial Value}} \end{aligned}​Holding Period Return​﻿
 
Returns computed for regular time periods such as quarters or years can be converted to a holding period return as well.
 
Holding period return is thus the total return received from holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a specified period of time, generally expressed as a percentage. Holding period return is calculated on the basis of total returns from the asset or portfolio (income plus changes in value). It is particularly useful for comparing returns between investments held for different periods of time.
 
Starting on the day after the security's acquisition and continuing until the day of its disposal or sale, the holding period determines tax implications. For example, Sarah bought 100 shares of stock on Jan. 2, 2016. When determining her holding period, she begins counting on Jan. 3, 2016. The third day of each month after that counts as the start of a new month, regardless of how many days each month contains.
 
If Sarah sold her stock on December 23, 2016, she would realize a short-term capital gain or capital loss because her holding period is less than one year. If she sells her stock on Jan. 3, 2017, she would realize a long-term capital gain or loss because her holding period is more than one year.
 
The following are some examples of calculating holding period return:
 
1. What is the HPR for an investor, who bought a stock a year ago at $50 and received $5 in dividends over the year, if the stock is now trading at $60?
 
﻿HPR=5+(60−50)50=30%\begin{aligned}HPR=\frac{5+(60-50)}{50}=30\%\end{aligned}HPR=505+(60−50)​=30%​﻿
 
2. Which investment performed better: Mutual Fund X, which was held for three years and appreciated from $100 to $150, providing $5 in distributions, or Mutual Fund B, which went from $200 to $320 and generated $10 in distributions over four years?
 
﻿HPR for Fund X=5+(150−100)100=55%\begin{aligned}&\textit{HPR for Fund X}=\frac{5+(150-100)}{100}=55\%\\[+.010pt]&\textit{HPR for Fund B}=\frac{10+(320-200)}{200}=65\%\end{aligned}​HPR for Fund X=1005+(150−100)​=55%​﻿
 
Note: Fund B had the higher HPR, but it was held for four years, as opposed to the three years for which Fund X was held. Since the time periods are different, this requires annualized HPR to be calculated, as shown below.
 
3. Calculation of annualized HPR:
 
﻿Annualized HPR for Fund X=(0.55+1)1/3−1=15.73%Annualized HPR for Fund B\begin{aligned}&\textit{Annualized HPR for Fund X}\\&\qquad=(0.55+1)^{1/3}-1=15.73\%\\&\textit{Annualized HPR for Fund B}\\&\qquad=(0.65+1)^{1/4}-1=13.34\%\end{aligned}​Annualized HPR for Fund X=(0.55+1)1/3−1=15.73%Annualized HPR for Fund B​﻿
 
Thus, despite having the lower HPR, Fund X was the superior investment.
 
4. Your stock portfolio had the following returns in the four quarters of a given year: +8%, -5%, +6%, +4%. How did it compare against the benchmark index, which had total returns of 12% over the year?
 
﻿HPR for your stock portfolio=[(1+0.08)×(1−0.05)×(1+0.06)×(1+0.04)]\begin{aligned}&\textit{HPR for your stock portfolio}\\&\qquad=[(1+0.08)\times(1-0.05)\times(1+0.06)\times(1+0.04)]\\&\qquad\quad-1=13.1\%\end{aligned}​HPR for your stock portfolio=[(1+0.08)×(1−0.05)×(1+0.06)×(1+0.04)]​﻿
 
Your portfolio, therefore, outperformed the index by more than a percentage point. (However, the risk of the portfolio should also be compared to that of the index to evaluate if the added return was generated by taking significantly higher risk.)

The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) is based on a monthly survey of members belonging to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). The index is designed to measure sentiment for the U.S. single-family housing market and is a widely watched gauge of the outlook for the U.S. housing sector. Since housing is a large investment, housing market indices help to monitor the overall health of the economy.
 
There are various housing market indices that look at different aspects of the housing market. The NAHB gets input from builders on how confident they are in the housing market based on buyer behavior, sales, and incorporates any forecasts as well.
 
The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index is a valuable indicator for financial analysts, the Federal Reserve, policymakers, economic analysts, and the news media.
 
Other housing market indices look at price trends. For example, the Standard & Poor’s report called the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index provides monthly trends in home prices in select cities as well as nationwide. Home prices can be an indicator of buyer interest and their confidence in the economy. If people are buying homes, they typically feel confident about the stability of their job.
 
The National Association of Home Builders is a federation of more than 800 state and local associations. Since 1985, the HMI has been based on a monthly survey completed by NAHB builder members. In completing the survey, builders rate housing market conditions based on their experiences. About 400 responses are obtained each month. Builders have direct involvement with local market conditions and can provide relevant and timely information on current housing market conditions and insights as to how home sales are likely to behave in the future.
 
The HMI is produced by the economics arm of the NAHB, one-third of whose members are home builders or remodelers. The remaining members are in closely related sectors such as building materials, housing finance, and real estate sales. NAHB’s builder members annually construct approximately 80% of the new homes built in the U.S.
 
The HMI is a weighted average of separate diffusion indexes. Its reading can range between 0 and 100; a reading over 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good compared with those who view them as poor.
 Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
The HMI is calculated as follows: the two series for market conditions for current new home sales and the next six months are rated on a scale of good, fair, and poor while the buyer traffic series is rated on a scale of high/very high, average, and low/very low.
 
A diffusion index is calculated for each series by applying the formula (good - poor + 100) / 2 to the present and future sales series and (high / very high - low / very low + 100) / 2 to the traffic series.
 
A diffusion index is then calculated for each series by applying these formulas, after which each resulting index is seasonally adjusted and weighted to generate the HMI.
 
The HMI displays a close correlation with U.S. single-family housing starts, which refers to the start of construction on privately-owned homes. Housing starts data are key indicators of how the U.S. economy is faring and are supplied monthly by the U.S. Census Bureau.
 
The HMI is a gauge of homebuyers’ intentions; it provides valuable clues on the near-term direction of housing starts. The HMI is released monthly at 10 a.m. EST the day before housing starts data are released by the Census Bureau, which is typically mid-month.
 
The NAHB/Wells Fargo HMI has significant power in predicting single-family housing starts and permits. The information provided by the HMI is as useful today as it has been over the past two decades.
