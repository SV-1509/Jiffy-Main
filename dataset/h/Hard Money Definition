Hard money is a term often used to describe a funding stream originating from a government agency or other organization. The flow of funds represents an ongoing and scheduled series of payments, rather than a one-time grant. Hard money could take the form of government daycare subsidies or annual scholarships to post-secondary students.
 
Hard money is also used to describe a physical currency, such as coins made out of precious metals including gold, silver or platinum. Also, circulating currency whose value ties directly to the value of a specific commodity is known as hard money. For instance, the Gold Standard once used by the United States could be called a hard money system.
 
Hard money can be contrasted with soft money, which may refer either to credit in lieu of physical cash or fiat money which is not backed by any commodity. Soft money may also mean indirect contributions or payment for financial services such as paying for brokerage commissions with research.
 
Hard money is a preferred form of funding by governments and organizations because it provides a predictable stream of funds. In the case of a student scholarship, it provides budget certainty to the student planning for his or her time in college. By comparison, one-off grants can make long-term planning and budgeting more challenging.
 
Hard money as it describes the nature of currency is less frequent in todayâ€™s global economy. Most countries use fiat money. Fiat is the process of creating a legal tender by government decree. The paper has no intrinsic value of its own without this fiat. Hard money has a value tied to the price of its underlying commodity. In contrast, the value of fiat money ties only to supply and demand factors. Using fiat money can give governments greater flexibility in the event of a financial crisis.
 
Hard money is also a term used in politics and lending.
