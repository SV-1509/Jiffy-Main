Nonprofit organizations are exempt from federal income taxes under subsection 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code. A nonprofit organization is an organization that engages in activities for both public and private interest without pursuing the goal of commercial or monetary profit. To be exempt from federal taxes, nonprofit organizations have to meet certain rules.
 
Key criteria that nonprofits must meet to be tax exempt include:
 Nontaxable nonprofits are more likely to generate donations, where the donor can use the donation to lower their own tax liability.   
Nonprofits, which can include private foundations and churches, are able to more readily raise money as a non-taxable organization. Individuals and other organizations are more likely to contribute nontaxable nonprofits because they can reduce their own tax liability.
 
Nonprofits are also exempt from paying sales tax and property tax. While the income of a nonprofit organization may not be subject to federal taxes, nonprofit organizations do pay employee taxes (Social Security and Medicare) just like any for-profit company.

If a nonprofit organization engages in activities that are unrelated to their basic purpose, they are required to pay income taxes on that money. For example, if nonprofit organization ABC was formed to provide shelter for the homeless and it makes some money selling bicycles, that income may be eligible for income tax purposes. With the tax benefits, however, comes greater inflexibility for nonprofits, which are subject to greater oversight.
