Everybody has biases. We make judgments about people, opportunities, government policies, and of course, the markets. When we analyze our world with our own biases, we put our observations through a number of filters manufactured by our experiences, and we're not just talking about stock screeners. We're talking about the filters we put our decisions through that sometimes make them biased. Individuals may or may not necessarily rationalize that their decisions are being made based on biases they have developed.
 
In general, all kinds of day-to-day activities are primarily driven by behavioral patterns. These same behavioral patterns can also influence investing actions.
 
For most people, it is impossible to be unbiased in investment decision-making. However, investors can mitigate biases by understanding and identifying them, then creating trading and investing rules that mitigate them when necessary. Broadly, investing biases fall into two main categories: cognitive and emotional. Both biases are usually the result of a prejudice for choosing one thing over the other.
 
Cognitive biases generally involve decisionmaking based on established concepts that may or may not be accurate. Think of a cognitive bias as a rule of thumb that may or may not be factual.
 
We’ve all seen movies where a thief wears a police uniform to pass through a security checkpoint. The real police officers assume that because the person is wearing a uniform like theirs, he must be a real police officer. That’s an example of a cognitive bias.
 
What does a fake cop have to do with your investment choices? You make the same types of assumptions that may or may not necessarily be true. Here are some examples:
 
Emotional biases typically occur spontaneously based on the personal feelings of an individual at the time a decision is made. They may also be deeply rooted in personal experiences that also influence decisionmaking.
 
Emotional biases are usually ingrained in the psychology of investors and can generally be harder to overcome than cognitive biases. Emotional biases are not necessarily always errors. In some cases, an investor’s emotional bias may help them to make a more protective and suitable decision for themselves.
 
Here are a few examples:
 
In general, a bias is usually the result of prejudice when choosing one thing over another. Biases can be influenced by experience, judgment, social norms, assumptions, academics, and more. Cognitive biases generally involve decisionmaking based on established concepts that may or may not be accurate. Emotional biases typically occur spontaneously based on the personal feelings of an individual at the time a decision is made. Emotional biases are usually not based on expansive conceptual reasoning. Both cognitive and emotional biases may or may not prove to be successful when influencing a decision.
 
In investing, taking steps to minimize unprofitable biases can be extremely helpful in making more money.
 
A few examples include:
 
One of the key ways to minimize unprofitable biases is to set objective trading rules and stick to them. Trading rules that mitigate unprofitable biases can help to override emotions and increase returns.
