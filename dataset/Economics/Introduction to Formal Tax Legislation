Formal tax legislation is the process by which a proposed tax rule or tax change may become law in the United States. Formal tax legislation follows specific steps as defined by the U.S. Constitution. The legislation, like all federal laws, requires the consent of both houses of Congress – the Senate and the House of Representatives – and presidential approval.
 
The proposed tax laws start the formal tax legislation process as a bill before it is to become law. The tax bill must be introduced in the House of Representatives because the House is supposed to represent individual citizens, rather than whole states, as with the Senate. The formal tax legislation process follows these specific steps:
 
Presidents can, and frequently do, recommend changes to current tax laws, but only Congress can make the changes.
 
Citizens can influence tax laws through the informal tax legislation process, which includes contacting members of Congress and elected officials, attending town or county meetings, participating in lobbying efforts, circulating and signing petitions, and by voting for particular candidates. Through this informal process, citizens act individually or collectively to influence the outcome of the formal tax legislation process by making their views known to legislators.
