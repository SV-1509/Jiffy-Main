Inelasticity and elasticity of demand refer to the degree to which demand responds to a change in another economic factor. Elasticity measures how demand shifts when other economic factors change. When fluctuating demand is unrelated to an economic factor, it is called inelasticity.
 
Price is the most common economic factor used when determining elasticity or inelasticity. Other factors include income level and substitute availability.
 
The elasticity of demand, or demand elasticity, refers to how sensitive demand for a good is compared to changes in other economic factors, such as price or income. It is commonly referred to as price elasticity of demand because price is the most common economic factor used to measure it.
 The elasticity of demand helps companies predict changes in demand based on a number of different factors, including changes in price and the market entry of competitive goods. 
An elastic product is defined as one where a change in price leads to a significant shift in demand. In general, the more substitutes there are for an item, the more elastic demand for it will be.
 
Elasticity of demand is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price. If the elasticity quotient is greater than or equal to one, the demand is considered to be elastic. 
 
Common examples of elastic products are consumer discretionaries such as a brand of cereal. Certain food products are not a necessity. For instance, it’s reasonable to argue that people would stop buying a particular brand of cereal if its price shot up dramatically, particularly if other comparable products didn’t follow suit and kept their prices the same.
 
Conversely, if this same brand of cereals experienced a steep price cut, we’d expect more people to buy it, assuming its level of quality is similar to peers and we aren't in a deep recession.
 
An inelastic product, on the other hand, is defined as one where a change in price does not significantly impact demand.
 
Should demand for a good or service be static when its price or other factor changes, it is said to be inelastic. In other words, when the price goes up or down, consumers will not change their buying habits.
 
Inelastic products are necessities and, usually, do not have substitutes they can easily be replaced with. So, if there is a 1% change in the price of a good, then the amount demanded or supplied will experience less than a 1% change.
 
Since the quantity demanded is the same regardless of the price, the demand curve for a perfectly inelastic good is graphed out as a vertical line.
 
There are no clear examples of a perfectly inelastic good. If this were the case, prices would skyrocket, without impacting demand. That said, there are some products that come close.
 
If the elasticity quotient is less than one, the demand is considered to be inelastic. The most common goods with inelastic demand are utilities, prescription drugs, and tobacco products.
 
Another typical example is salt. The human body requires a specific amount of salt per pound of body weight. Too much or too little salt could cause illness or even death, so demand for it changes very little with price—salt has an elasticity quotient that is close to zero and a steep slope on a graph.
