Tax fraud occurs when an individual or business entity willfully and intentionally falsifies information on a tax return to limit the amount of tax liability. Tax fraud essentially entails cheating on a tax return in an attempt to avoid paying the entire tax obligation.

Tax fraud does not include mistakes or accidental reporting, which the IRS calls negligent reporting.
