A tax refund is a reimbursement to a taxpayer of any excess amount paid to the federal government or a state government.
 
Taxpayers tend to look at a refund as a bonus or a stroke of luck, but it really represents an interest-free loan that a taxpayer makes to the government. In most cases, it is avoidable.
 
There are a number of reasons a taxpayer may get a refund of more than a trivial amount of money (or owe more than a trivial amount to the government):
 
The first two examples are easily avoided. That is, the money would have been paid to the taxpayer over the course of the year is the correct information was on the W-4 form.
 
Of course, sometimes a tax refund is both unavoidable and welcome. For instance, a taxpayer who was laid off early in the year and was unable to get a new job immediately might receive a substantial refund based on his or her actual annual income.
 
Most tax credits are non-refundable. That is, a taxpayer who owes nothing forfeits the tax credit. But there are exceptions.
 
Refundable tax credits include:
 
Tax refunds can be issued in the form of personal checks, U.S. savings bonds, or direct deposits to the taxpayer's bank account, among other options. Most are issued within a few weeks of the date the taxpayer initially files a return.﻿﻿
 A tax refund is repayment of an interest-free loan to the government, not a happy windfall. It can usually be avoided. 
Refunds are always pleasant, but it would be better to avoid over-paying in the first place by claiming the proper number of allowances on your W-4 form or more precisely calculating your estimated taxes.
 
Not everyone agrees. Some people consider it an alternative savings plan and look forward to the lump sum repayment.
