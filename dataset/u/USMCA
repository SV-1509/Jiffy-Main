The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, also known as the USMCA, is a trade deal between the three nations which was signed on November 30, 2018.﻿﻿ The USMCA replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which had been in effect since January of 1994. Under the terms of NAFTA, tariffs on many goods passing between North America's three major economic powers were gradually phased out. By 2008, tariffs on various agricultural and textiles products, automobiles, and other goods were reduced or eliminated.﻿﻿
 
The idea of a replacement for NAFTA dates back before President Trump's election, as a candidate, President Trump campaigned on renegotiating NAFTA in order to try and get more favorable terms for the U.S. Trump The USMCA began to officially take shape when the Trump administration sent the required 90-day notice to Congress that he was going to begin talks to renegotiate NAFTA. The talks officially began on August 16, 2017 and ended September 30, 2018.﻿﻿
 
First, the Mexican Senate ratified the deal on June 19, 2019, and approved amendments to it on December 12, 2019.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Then, on December 19, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to approve the USMCA. The legislation passed the Senate in January 16, 2020, and on January 29 President Trump signed it into law.﻿﻿ Finally, the Canadian Parliament ratified the treaty on March 13, 2020.﻿﻿
 
Several difficulties emerged before the treaty went into effect on July 1, 2020. First, on May 31, 2019 President Trump said starting June 10 the U.S. will impose a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports. He threatened this increase in tariffs unless the Mexican government took sterner measures to lower the number of Central American asylum seekers entering the U.S. from Mexico. A deal was reached to avoid the tariffs on June 8, 2020.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Second, as the date of the treaty neared, reports emerged that the Trump administration was planning to implement tariffs on Canadian aluminum on July 1, 2020, just as the new trade deal takes effect. This could spark retaliatory tariffs from Canada.﻿﻿
 
Per the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the USMCA is a "mutually beneficial win for North American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses." NAFTA aimed to create a free trade zone between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the USMCA utilizes NAFTA as a basis for a new agreement. While the USMCA has a broad impact on trade of all kinds between the three named nations, some of the agreement's most important provisions include the following:﻿﻿
