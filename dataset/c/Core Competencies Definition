Core competencies are the resources and capabilities that comprise the strategic advantages of a business. A modern management theory argues that a business must define, cultivate, and exploit its core competencies in order to succeed against the competition.
 
A variation of the principle that has emerged in recent years recommends that job seekers focus on their personal core competencies in order to stand out from the crowd. These positive characteristics may be developed and listed on a resume. Some personal core competencies include analytical abilities, creating thinking, and problem resolution skills.
 
A successful business has identified what it can do better than anyone else, and why. Its core competencies are the "why."
 
Core competency is a relatively new management theory that originated in a 1990 Harvard Business Review article, “The Core Competence of the Corporation.”
 
In the article, C.K. Prahalad, and Gary Hamel review three conditions a business activity must meet in order to be a core competency:

Once it understands those competencies, the company can properly focus all of those resources.

A business is not limited to just one core competency, and competencies vary based on the industry in which the institution operates.
 A core competence must offer a superior benefit, must be rare, and must be hard to replicate or imitate. 
Some of the core competencies of established and successful brands tend to be there for all to see:
 
The core competencies that distinguish a business vary by industry. A hospital or clinic may focus on excellence in particular specializations. A manufacturer may identify superior quality control.
