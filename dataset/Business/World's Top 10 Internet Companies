Internet‑based companies generate revenue through online sales, financial transaction fees, paid advertising, cloud services, and a host of other business lines. The years 2018 and 2019 were particularly strong growth years for this sector.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ The following 10 publicly traded Internet-based companies topped the list.
 
Because Internet businesses are highly dynamic, innovation and advances in the tech space mean that new entrants can grow quickly and displace current leaders. Companies can also surge significantly, only to lose steam or fizzle out entirely—a notorious phenomenon of the 2000 dot-com bubble burst. Investors should, therefore, conduct thorough due diligence before investing in Internet-based companies.
