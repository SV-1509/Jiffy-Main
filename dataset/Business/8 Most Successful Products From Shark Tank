Premiering in 2009, ABC's entrepreneur pitch show Shark Tank has seen it all. The premise of the show is simple: inventors and entrepreneurs pitch their products to real-life investors (called sharks). The sharks evaluate the products and decide whether to back the fledgling companies with their own money.﻿﻿ From alarm clocks that wake you up with the smell of bacon to a scented candle that simulates the most alluring scents to attract a man (apparently this is beer, pot roast, and barbecue), the show has exposed its audience of as many as 5 million viewers to some of the silliest inventions ever conceived. However, over the years, the sharks have also seen some great ideas that just needed an investor (with deep pockets) to take off. Here are the top eight most successful products that got their start in the Shark Tank.
 
Over the years, the Shark Tank stage has seen many great ideas and also a lot of duds. The countdown of its eight greatest products demonstrate there is still room for new ideas. No doubt, by offering exposure to millions of viewers and funding from shark investors, the Shark Tank will continue to launch successful entrepreneurs and products.
