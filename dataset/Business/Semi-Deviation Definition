Semi-deviation is a method of measuring the below-mean fluctuations in the returns on investment.
 Semi-deviation will reveal the worst-case performance to be expected from a risky investment. 
Semi-deviation is an alternative measurement to standard deviation or variance. However, unlike those measures, semi-deviation looks only at negative price fluctuations. Thus, semi-deviation is most often used to evaluate the downside risk of an investment.
 
In investing, semi-deviation is used to measure the dispersion of an asset's price from an observed mean or target value. In this sense, dispersion means the extent of variation from the mean price.
 
The point of the exercise is to determine the severity of the downside risk of an investment. The asset's semi-deviation number can then be compared to a benchmark number, such as an index, to see if it is more or less risky than other potential investments.
 
The formula for semi-deviation is:
 
﻿Semi-deviation = 1n × ∑rt < Averagen(Average − rt)2where:n = the total number of observations below the meanrt = the observed value\begin{aligned}&\text{Semi-deviation}\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\ \times\ \sum^n_{r_t\ <\ \text{Average}}(\text{Average}\ -\ r_t)^2}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&n\ =\ \text{the total number of observations below the mean}\\&r_t\ =\ \text{the observed value}\\&\text{average}\ =\text{the mean or target value of a data set}\end{aligned}​Semi-deviation = n1​ × rt​ < Average∑n​(Average − rt​)2​where:n = the total number of observations below the meanrt​ = the observed value​﻿
 
An investor's entire portfolio could be evaluated according to the semi-deviation in the performance of its assets. Put bluntly, this will show the worst-case performance that can be expected from a portfolio, compared to the losses in an index or whatever comparable is selected.
 
Semi-deviation was introduced in the 1950s specifically to help investors manage risky portfolios. Its development is credited to two leaders in modern portfolio theory.
