A professional employer organization (PEO)—sometimes referred to as an employee leasing company—is a human resources company that is contracted by small companies to take over certain administrative functions, such as payroll, taxes, and employee benefits. The PEO, in effect, becomes a co-employer, an arrangement that allows it to combine the employees of several companies in order to offer those companies lower costs, reduced paperwork, and increased efficiency, as well as better retirement, healthcare, and workers’ compensation packages for their employees.
 
More than 800 PEOs in the U.S. provide a variety of services to between 156,000 and 180,000 small and medium-sized companies employing 2.7 to 3.4 million people. As a co-employer, the PEO becomes the legal and tax-related employer for the employees of all client companies. This allows the PEO to negotiate more expansive and less expensive benefits, workers’ comp, and unemployment insurance rates while offering state-of-the-art administrative services. The average client of a PEO, according to the National Association of Professional Employer Organizations (NAPEO), is a small business with 19 employees.

To better understand the role of a PEO in business, it’s important to know the following:
 PEOs are not the same as temporary employment agencies. 
Some people confuse PEOs with temporary employment, or “temp,” agencies. The two are quite different, even though some services offered appear to be similar. Temp agencies recruit employees and assign them to businesses on a short-term basis to help with overload or special projects or on an “as needed” basis. PEOs, as noted above, are co-employers and take on several administrative functions for clients.
