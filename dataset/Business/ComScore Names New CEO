ComScore Inc. (SCOR) has named a new CEO, filling a void left from the departure of the company’s co-founder Gian Fulgoni, who retired late last year.
 
The media-measurement company said it has appointed Bryan Wiener, executive chairman of 360i, a media agency owned by Dentsu Inc., the Japanese advertising firm. He’s current a member of ComScore's board.
 
ComScore has been riddled with several crises and losses regarding its accounting, having recently released its first annual report in three years. ComScore, The Wall Street Journal reported, had used a practiced called “nonmonetary revenue” that recorded revenue from data-swapping deals.
 
Now, Wiener is charged with helping ComScore streamline complex operations and build products that can help the company shake its recent turmoil. He will be the company’s third CEO in three years. He first joined the company as part of a settlement with Starboard Value LP, an activist investor that demanded more independent board members as part of its agreement to drop a lawsuit calling for an annual meeting.
 
“The worst is behind us,” Wiener told the Journal. “The last two years were a very difficult time. It was hard to innovate at the speed we wanted to innovate with that could over our head.”
 
ComScore tracks media consumption metrics like TV viewing, film performance and digital publishing. Its competitors include TV ratings firm Nielsen Holdings (NLSN). (See also: More Time Spent on Google Sites Than Facebook: Study.)
 
 ComScore’s stock is down 15.7% in the past year.
