The feeding frenzy has begun: “Shark Tank,” ABC’s wildly popular entrepreneur pitch show, is back for an eighth season. Over the years, hundreds of people have appeared in the tank seeking investments and guidance from a panel of five successful venture capitalists collectively known as the “Sharks.” While some have walked away without a deal, many have walked away richer than they could have ever imagined.

Break-even: A quick way to measure a business’s sustainability and potential for future success.
 
Equity: Every entrepreneur comes into the tank seeking a Shark that is willing to pay for equity, or partial ownership, of the company. 
 
Liquidity: The more liquid a company’s assets are, they more easily they can be converted into cash. Sharks love that.
 
Margin: Wondering what the Sharks are scrawling on their notepads all the time? Chances are they’re calculating margins, which measure a business’s efficiency.  
 
Market Value: The price a product would fetch on the market.

Patent: A government license that protects original ideas. Shark Lori Greiner has over one hundred of them for her inventions.
 
Profit: A business’s total revenue less its expenses. The bigger the profit, the more likely the Sharks will bite.

Royalty: If you have a patent, you’re entitled to future royalties.
