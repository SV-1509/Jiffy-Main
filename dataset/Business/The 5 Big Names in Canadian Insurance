Across the world, insurance companies in recent years have combined with brokerage companies, banks, and other financial institutions to offer their customers a wider range of services. That is certainly the case for the Canadian insurance industry, which has experienced a number of acquisitions and mergers in recent years.
 
Below are the five largest Canadian insurance companies defined by their annual revenues in 2019. The revenue figures mostly include insurance premiums charged to policyholders, earnings from investing those premiums, and other insurance products embedded in investment products such as mututal funds.
 
It's important to note that many insurance companies offer other financial services, such as wealth management. As a result, some financial firms might be larger than the companies listed here, but their insurance businesses are not one of the largest components of their revenue.
 
All numbers reported are in Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars at a rate of $1.30 Canadian per U.S. dollar.
