Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, more commonly known by his first name Neymar, or Neymar Jr., is a Brazilian soccer (aka football) phenom born in 1992, and the star forward for Paris Saint-Germain FC (PSG). He is also one of the most handsomely compensated players in the game today.  
 
Neymar was born in Mogi Das Cruzes, Brazil on Feb. 5, 1992, in the southeast of the Sao Paulo state. Neymar started his youth career at the club Portuguesa Santista, where he played for about four years, before moving to the Brazilian giant Santos FC in 2003. Neymar broke into the first team at Santos in 2009 at age 17.﻿﻿ 
 
During his time at Santos, Neymar helped the club win the Brazilian first league, two consecutive Brazilian cups, and the Copa Libertadores, a continental cup. The club's Copa Libertadores win was their first title in the competition since 1963, when Pelé was on the team. Later that year (2011), Neymar was awarded the first of two consecutive South American Footballer of the Year Awards.﻿﻿ 
 
In the summer of 2013, Neymar joined FC Barcelona and signed a contract through 2018.﻿﻿ At Barcelona, Neymar helped the club win the league, the domestic cup, and the Champions League, among other competitions.﻿﻿ 
 
In 2016, Neymar signed a contract extension with FC Barcelona that included a release clause of €200 million if traded in the first year, and €222 million the following year.﻿﻿ In 2017, PSG paid €222 million (about $246 million) for the rights to Neymar, triggering the largest-ever transfer fee of all-time. He is currently under contract with PSG until 2022.﻿﻿
 Neymar was included in Time magazine's 2017 list of the 100 most influential people in the world. 
According to the Forbes list of "World’s Highest-Paid Athletes" in 2020, Neymar is the fourth-highest-paid athlete in the world, moving down one place since 2019.﻿﻿ He is outranked only by his fellow soccer players Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and tennis player Roger Federer.﻿﻿
 
The Forbes ranking claims Neymar was paid $96 million in 2020, of which $78 million comes from his salaried earnings and winnings. The other $18 million is from endorsements,﻿﻿ with companies like Red Bull (which sponsors his worldwide competitive football tournament Neymar Jr's Five), Gillette, McDonald's, Beats by Dre, and German sportswear company Puma.
 
He was the first soccer player to have his own custom Air Jordan sneakers made by the Swoosh.﻿﻿ He has also held sponsorship deals with Volkswagen, Tenys Pé Baruel, Lupo, Ambev, Claro, Unilever, and Santander.
 
He has appeared in two TV series and two films, including XXX: Return of Xander Cage, playing himself. A big fan of Brazilian pop music, he has appeared in several videos and performed live with singer Gusttavo Lima.
 
Sources estimate that Neymar's net worth is in the ballpark—or should we say stadium?—of $200 million.﻿﻿
