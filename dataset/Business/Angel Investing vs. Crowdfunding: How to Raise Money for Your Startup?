Raising capital is one of the biggest challenges any startup can face, but fortunately, entrepreneurs have more than one option for getting the funding they need. Seeking out angel investors has its advantages, but crowdfunding is redefining how fledgling companies get off the ground. Both have their pros and cons, and it's important to understand how they can impact your startup's long-term outlook before diving in. (For more, see the tutorial:  Starting a Small Business.)
 
The typical angel investor is a high-net-worth individual who has an interest in helping new companies expand. These accredited investors provide startups with seed money in exchange for an equity stake in the company. The idea here is that once the company becomes profitable, the angel investor can sell their shares for a profit.
 
Angel investors can operate independently or as part of a larger investment group, sometimes known as a syndicate. In terms of how much money angel investors can bring to the table, it's not unusual for a typical investment to range from $25,000 to $100,000. In some instances, angel investors may be willing to part with even larger sums to assist a startup. (For more, read: When Your Business Needs Money: Angel Investors.)

Angel investing is a good option for startups to raise large amounts of capital without being constrained by the requirements that go along with taking out a loan. The main disadvantage, however, is the fact that it requires trading off a certain amount of ownership in the company. While rewards-based crowdfunding offers a work-around to that dilemma, the fees can quickly add up. Weighing the loss of equity against cost can make it easier for startups to decide which option is best.
