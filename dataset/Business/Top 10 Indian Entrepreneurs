India is the world's largest democracy, and its economy has been growing rapidly over the past few decades. As a country, it also holds the second-largest native population behind China. Not surprisingly, India has produced a number of billionaire businessmen and businesswomen.
 
Although there are still many who live in poverty due to India's high levels of income inequality, the country has maintained a long tradition of entrepreneurship and wealth creation.

Today, through gradual development and a series of acquisitions, that investment has grown to a value of nearly 2 trillion rupees, making Sun India's largest pharmaceutical company.

Ardeshir Godrej (1868-1936) co-founded the Godrej Group, a diversified conglomerate with interests in real estate, consumer products, security, household appliances, and industrial tools.

Godrej Group was founded in 1897, and the Godrej companies have revenues of over $4.7 billion today.﻿﻿ His grandson, Adi Godrej, who runs the company, is worth $1.9 billion.﻿﻿
 The GDP per capita in India, which has risen in recent years.﻿﻿ 
India has a long tradition of entrepreneurship, but with its own distinct flavor. Rather than founding technology firms, many Indian entrepreneurs came from hard-working, humble beginnings and created conglomerates that were passed down from generation to generation as family businesses. But that's not to say that future Indian entrepreneurs won't focus on technology and help drive India's economic growth.
 
Still, we should not forget that GDP per capita in this country of over 1 billion people is just $2,010 per year, demonstrating one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world.﻿﻿
