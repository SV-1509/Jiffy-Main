Legendary value investor Warren Buffett has never done a stock split of his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A) Class A shares, reasoning that to do so would counter his basicÂ  buy-and-hold investment philosophy. Simply put: Buffett focuses on high-quality companies with long-term growth and profit potential. And by refusing to split Berkshire Hathaway's Class A stock shares, Buffett seeks to attract investors after his own heart--namely those interested in long term plays, who have extended investment horizons.
 
Interestingly, Buffett created Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares (BRK-B), which sell for a fraction of the Class A share price, with the stated purpose of enabling retail investors to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock directly. Unlike the company's Class A shares, Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares have the potential to split. This, in fact, occurred in 2010, with an astonishing 50 to one split. While some might argue that this action contradicts Buffett's no-split posture on his Class A shares, this duality is quite intentional, as it lets Buffett avail an affordable version of Berkshire Hathaway stock to smaller investors.
