When a young company decides to sell stock in an initial public offering (IPO), it contacts an investment bank to manage the process. This is the team of underwriters who will help determine the price of the stock, describe and market it to prospective investors, document its financials, submit the required legal documents, and, finally, launch the IPO on a stock exchange.
 
The underwriter may or may not make guarantees concerning the successful sale of all shares made available in the IPO.
 
Every deal varies, particularly in the amount of risk that the underwriter agrees to take on and how the underwriter will be compensated. The two most common types of underwriting are bought deals and best effort deals.
 
Less commonly, there is the "all or none" agreement. The company and its underwriter agree that the IPO will be canceled if all shares are not sold.
 
The underwriters for IPOs are some of the biggest global names in banking and investing. They include Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, and Merrill Lynch, to name a few.
 
An IPO often involves more than one underwriter, with one lead underwriter in the most prominent role. That is the "bookrunner." The other underwriters become "co-managers" with smaller shares of responsibility for the success of the IPO and smaller percentages of the proceeds.
