Has served as the chairman and CEO of magazine company Time Inc., which owns more than 150 magazines, including Time, People, Real Simple, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Money and Discover. Born in Mississippi in 1950, Moore joined the company as a financial analyst in 1978 upon earning an MBA from Harvard Business. In the 1990s, when she served first as publisher and then as president of People, she helped to expand the company's women's titles, launching In Style, People en Español, Teen People, and Real Simple.
 
Moore has repeatedly been named to Fortune magazine's annual list, "The 50 Most Powerful Women in American Business." She earned her MBA from Harvard Business School and is the first female CEO of Time.
 
A graduate of Vanderbilt University in 1971, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, once Moore joined Time Inc, she quickly became instrumental in driving forward the brand. Part of her success may be attributed to measures she enacted in order to modernize People Magazine’s format. Among the key changes under her tenure, the magazine switched its design scheme from black-and-white to color. Moore likewise augmented the publication’s content to include fashion and beauty sections. Although the Time Inc. higher-ups were initially skeptical of these bold moves, Moore’s actions proved successful, and People soon out-earned Time Inc.'s traditional leader, Time Magazine, in advertising revenue. And by 2001, People Magazine brought in $723.7 million in ad money, compared to Time Magazine's $666 million.
 
Moore may also be credited for helping to spearhead the movement to usher Time Inc. into the digital age, in order make its content and marketing more current. By all accounts, she flourished with this effort, driving digital traffic growth up by 72%. And despite the U.S. economic downturn of 2008, revenue for People.com climbed 51%.
 
In addition to becoming the driving force behind People Magazine, Moore also became the publisher of Sports Illustrated for Kids, in 1989. By drawing on her current network of clients, Moore was able to successfully pre-sell advertising pages, in order to hit the ground running. Moore fostered a climate of close relationships between the publication’s editorial staff, marketing division and circulation desk—a move which impressed the magazine’s founding editor John Papanek, who praised her more integrated infrastructure.
 
Other successful efforts Moore oversaw included spin-off publications, including the Australian version of People, which was entitled WHO.
