Barry Diller was born on February 2, 1942 in San Francisco and attended (but did not graduate from) UCLA. He began his career in the mailroom of the Hollywood talent agency, the William Morris Agency, in 1961. By 1965, he was Vice President of Development with ABC. He helped ABC compete with other major networks by introducing ABC's Movie of the Week in 1969 with directors such as Aaron Spelling and Steven Spielberg. Made-for-TV movies became an industry practice because they were inexpensive and quick to produce.
 
Diller went on to become Chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures Corporation in 1974 and Chairman of the Board and CEO of Fox, Inc. from 1984 to 1992. At Fox, he launched the Fox Broadcasting Company to compete with ABC, CBS and NBC. The network aired hit shows such as Cops, Married With Children and The Simpsons. He left Fox in 1992 to become CEO of QVC Network, where he made an unsuccessful bid to take over Paramount. After leaving QVC Network in 1995, he became Chairman of the Board and CEO of Silver King Communications, Inc. (the predecessor of IAC) in 1995, Chairman of the Board of Home Shopping Network (HSN) in 1996, and co-CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment in 2002.
