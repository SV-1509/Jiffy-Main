Qualified small business stock (QSBS) refers to shares of a qualified small business (QSB) as defined by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). A QSB is an active domestic C corporation whose gross assets—valued at the original cost—do not exceed $50 million on and immediately after its stock issuance.﻿﻿
 
Eligible individuals meeting certain criteria are able to receive tax benefits if they hold qualified small business stock (QSBS).﻿﻿
 
The federal government allows individuals to invest in small businesses under Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). As noted above, a QSB is any active domestic C corporation whose assets don't go over $50 million on or after the issuance of stock.﻿﻿
 
Only certain types of companies fall under the category of a QSB. Firms in the technology, retail, wholesale, and manufacturing sectors are eligible as QSBs, while those in the hospitality industry, personal services, the financial sector, farming, and mining are not.﻿﻿
 
A qualified small business stock (QSBS) is any stock acquired from a QSB after Aug. 10, 1993. Under Section 1202, the capital gains from qualified small businesses are exempt from federal taxes. To claim the tax benefits of the stock being qualified, the following must apply:
 
The tax treatment for a QSB stock depends on when the stock was acquired and how long it was held. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) of 2015 allows investors to exclude 100% of capital gains on qualified small business stock (QSBS).﻿﻿ The exclusion has a cap of $10 million, or 10 times the adjusted basis of the stock—whichever is greater.﻿﻿ Gains above that amount are subject to a 28% capital gains tax.﻿﻿
 Qualified small business stock (QSBS) can be eligible for a capital gains exclusion of up to 100%.﻿﻿ 
Additionally, there are holding requirements for the full exclusion of alternative minimum tax (AMT) and net investment income (NII) tax. The AMT is typically imposed on individuals whose tax exemptions would otherwise allow them to pay disproportionately low taxes for someone at their income level.
 
The NII tax, meanwhile, is applied to the lower amount between an individual's NII or the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) amount in excess of the predetermined limit.﻿﻿ The following is a list of how exclusions apply:
 
If someone invested $1.5 million in a tech startup on Oct. 1, 2010, and held that investment for five years, they could sell their qualified small business stock (QSBS) for up to $16.5 million (10 x their original investment of $1.5 million + $1.5 million) without owing capital gains tax. Once they deduct their initial investment, they have a $15 million capital gain—none of which is taxable on their federal income tax.
 
Similarly, an investor who put $500,000 into the same tech startup would be able to sell their shares for up to $10.5 million ($10 million + $500,000), with no tax on their capital gain of $10 million. However, if the investor's proceeds from the sale totaled $20 million, a 28% capital gains tax would be applied to the additional $10 million gain.
 
Stockholders who want to sell qualified small business stock (QSBS) not held for the minimum five-year holding period can also benefit. Section 1045 of the IRC allows them to defer the gain by reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of that qualified small business stock (QSBS) into another QSBS within 60 days.﻿﻿
 
Qualified startups and qualified existing businesses that want to expand their operations may raise initial or additional capital through a qualified small business stock (QSBS) offering.
 
These companies can also use qualified small business stock (QSBS) as a form of in-kind payment, which is frequently used to compensate employees for their services when cash flow is minimal. Qualified small business stock (QSBS) might be used as well to retain employees and as an incentive to help the company grow and succeed.
