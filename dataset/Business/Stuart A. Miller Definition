Stuart A. Miller guided the home construction company, Lennar, through the acquisition of numerous home builders, more than doubling the company's size during his tenure as chief executive officer. His management style famously involved the use of Dr. Seuss stories and fairy tales to impart business lessons to employees and other stakeholders. Miller helped grow Lennar into one of the largest home builders in the United States. A key to the company's success was its ability to branch out into all aspects of construction services. The company's operations included house construction and sales, land development, mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services, insurance agency services, high-speed Internet access, cable television, and alarm installation and monitoring services. Miller understood that by diversifying Lennar's operations, he could tap into all the needs of house buyers and provide them with a complete service platform.
 
Miller understood that intelligent and well-researched land acquisitions were essential to the company's success. By closely following the markets across the country, Lennar was able to acquire prime property in depressed markets poised for a comeback. For example, in the late 1990's the San Francisco Bay area housing market crashed. In response, Lennar bought property in the area at a reduced price, believing that the market would eventually come back. It did, and Lennar prospered. "We respond to opportunities," Miller said in an interview with Marilyn Alva of Investor's Business Daily . "We recognize that market trends do change."
