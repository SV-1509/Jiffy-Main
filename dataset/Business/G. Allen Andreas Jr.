Born in 1943 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, G. Allen Andreas Jr. joined Archer Daniels Midland in 1973, working on the legal team. Prior to working for the family corporation, Andreas worked in the U.S. Treasury Department in Denver. He took over the role of CEO at Archer Daniels Midland in the late 1990s from his uncle, Dwayne Andreas.
