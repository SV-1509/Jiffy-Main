Entrepreneurs come up with new ideas and start businesses based on them. They forgo the security of a salaried job to take on their own endeavor, assuming all the risk in hopes of great rewards. A serial entrepreneur takes on this challenge repeatedly. Once a particular business is established, they delegate the responsibility of running its operations and move on to other ventures. They may even sell earlier businesses. Serial entrepreneurs often experience windfall gains when their companies are sold at high premiums or continue to generate profits without much effort on their part.
 
This article lists, in alphabetical order, 10 of the top serial entrepreneurs; it's not exhaustive nor is it a ranking.
 
Entrepreneurial ventures can offer huge financial gains, but require dedication, time, energy, the vision to succeed and the courage to fail. Serial entrepreneurs work their way from one business to another, not merely sitting back and reaping the rewards of their past successes, but banking on their experience to start new ventures. Many of them have established themselves in a diversified set of businesses, and their successes, as well as their failures, provide important lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs.
