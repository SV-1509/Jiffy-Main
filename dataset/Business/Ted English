Ted English was the chief executive officer (CEO) of Bob's Discount Furniture starting in 2006 until March 2016, and a former CEO of TJX Companies - owner of TJ Maxx - from 2000 to 2006. He helped TJX, a Fortune 500 retailer, increase its sales and profits considerably, opening more than 900 new stores and employing more than 50,000 people, and led the company through several acquisitions.

English's strengths as a CEO included his ability to focus on merchandising, produce innovative ideas, predict customer shopping habits, and direct ongoing growth. English managed TJX with the primary goal of "capturing customers during hard times and then keep[ing] them when times get better". To capture new customers and retain existing ones while increasing profits, English continuously analyzed and applied new and innovative merchandising principles to the store's operations.
