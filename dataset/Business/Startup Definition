A startup is a young company founded by one or more entrepreneurs to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. By its nature, the typical startup tends to be a shoestring operation, with initial funding from the founders or their friends and families.
 
One of the startup's first tasks is raising a substantial amount of money to further develop the product. To do that, they have to make a strong argument, if not a prototype, that supports their claim that their idea is truly new or a great improvement to something on the market.
 
Though a vast majority of startups fail, some of history's most successful entrepreneurs created startups like Microsoft (founded by Bill Gates), Ford Motors (founded by Henry Ford), and McDonald's (founded by Ray Kroc).
 
In the early stages, startup companies have little or no revenue coming in. They have an idea that they have to develop, test, and market. That takes considerable money, and startup owners have several potential sources to tap:
 
Startups have no history and less profit to show. That makes investing in them risky. If an idea seems to have merit, potential investors may use any of several approaches to estimate how much money it could take to get it off the ground.
 
Because startups have a high failure rate, would-be investors consider the management team's experience as well as the idea. Even angel investors don't invest money they cannot afford to lose.
