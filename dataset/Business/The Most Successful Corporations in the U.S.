Because there are many ways to measure a company's success, here are the most successful companies in the U.S. as measured by five different metrics. The metrics are Sales, Profits, Shareholder Returns, Quality of Workplace, and Carbon Footprint. Data for Sales, Profit, and Shareholder Returns are measured over the last 12 months, and Employee Satisfaction and Carbon footprint are as of the most recently available data..
