The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office is investigating whether President Donald Trump's 2017 inaugural committee misspent the $107 million it received as donations, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.
 
Unnamed sources also told the paper that the criminal probe is looking into whether the top donors to the committee gave money "in exchange for access to the incoming Trump administration, policy concessions or to influence official administration positions."
 
The report did not mention which specific donors are under investigation.
 
Here are the top 15 corporations that donated to the committee, according to Federal Election Commission filings accessed by OpenSecrets.org:
 
Individual donors associated with high-profile organizations also gave generously to the committee.
 
Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s (LVS) Sheldon Adelson gave $5 million, making him the biggest donor overall.
 
Stewart & Stevenson chairman Hushang Ansary's wife, Shahla, gave $2 million.
 
Owners of sports teams — including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Texans, New York Jets, Los Angeles Rams, Washington Redskins and Jacksonville Jaguars — all gave $1 million each.
 
Among players in the financial industry, Charles Shwab, Paul Singer, Robert Mercer, Steven Cohen, Andrew Beal, Henry Kravis, Howard Lutnick and Scott Bessent all donated $1 million each.
 
Leaders at energy companies Hess Corp. (HES), Foresight Energy LP (FELP) and Rosebud Mining also donated $1 million each in their individual capacities.
