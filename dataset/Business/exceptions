Legendary investor Warren Buffett invented the “90/10" investing strategy for the investment of retirement savings. The method involves deploying 90% of one's investment capital into interest-bearing instruments which present a lower degree of investment risk while allocating the remaining 10% of money towards higher-risk investments. This system is a relatively conservative investment strategy which aims to generate higher yields on the overall portfolio. Following this method, proponents profess the potential losses will typically be limited to the 10% invested in the high-risk investments. However, much depends on the quality of the interest-bearing bonds purchased.
 
A typical application of the 90/10 strategy involves the use of short-term Treasury Bills for the 90%, fixed-income component of the portfolio. Investment of the remaining 10% is in higher risk securities such as equity, index options or warrants.
 
For example, an investor with a US$100,000 portfolio electing to employ a 90/10 strategy, might invest $90,000 in one-year Treasury Bills which yield 4% per annum. The remaining $10,000 goes either towards equities or stocks listed in the S&P 500 or to an index fund.
 
Of course, the “90/10” rule is merely a suggested benchmark, which may be easily modified to reflect a given investor’s tolerance to investment risk. Investors with higher risk tolerance levels can adjust greater equity portions to the equation. For instance, an investor who sits at the upper end of the risk spectrum may adopt a 70/30 or even 60/40 split model. The only requirement is that the investor earmarks the more substantial portion of the portfolio funds for safer investments, such as shorter-term bonds which have an A- or better rating.
 
To calculate the returns on such a portfolio, the investor must multiply the allocation by the return and then add those results. Using the example above, if the S&P 500 returns 10% at the end of one year, the calculation is (0.90 x 4% + 0.10 x 10%) resulting in a 4.6% return.
 
However, if the S&P 500 declines by 10%, the overall return on the portfolio after one year would be 2.6% using the calculation (0.90 x 4% + 0.10 x -10%). (For related reading, see "Is Warren Buffett's 90/10 Asset Allocation Sound?")
 
Buffet not only advocates for the 90/10 plan in theory, but he actively puts this principle into practice as reported by Fortune Magazine. Most notably, as a trust and estate planning directive for his wife, as laid out in his will. He once explained:

When most people challenge deeply ingrained wisdom about finances, they’re greeted with eye rolls. When one of the world’s most successful financial gurus is the contrarian, people listen.
 
Such was the case with Warren Buffett’s 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors, which seemed to challenge one of the longstanding axioms about retirement planning. Buffett noted that, upon his passing, the trustee of his wife’s inheritance was instructed to put 90% of her money into a very low-fee stock index fund and 10% into short-term government bonds.﻿﻿ 
 
For investors regularly told to steer away from stocks as they age, this was pretty shocking stuff. A well-worn adage is to maintain a percentage of stocks equal to 100 minus one’s age, at least as a rule of thumb. So when you hit the age of, say, 70, most of your investment assets would be high-quality bonds that generally don’t take as big a hit during market downturns.
 
Because people are generally living longer and need to stretch their nest egg, some experts have suggested being a little more aggressive. Now, it’s more common to hear about 110 minus your age, or even 120 minus your age, as an appropriate portion of stocks. But 90% in equities, at any age? Even for someone with Buffett’s bona fides, that seems like a risky proposition.
 The rule of thumb advisors have traditionally urged investors to use, in terms of the percentage of stocks an investor should have in their portfolio; this equation suggests, for example, that a 30-year-old would hold 70% in stocks, 30% in bonds, while a 60-year-old would have 40% in stocks, 60% in bonds. 
Now, it’s important to point out that the Oracle of Omaha didn’t say that the 90/10 split makes sense for every investor. The larger point he was trying to make was about the makeup of portfolios, not the precise allocation. His main contention was that most investors will get better returns through low-cost, low-turnover index funds, an interesting admission for someone who’s made a fortune picking individual stocks.﻿﻿ 
 
And there’s an obvious distinction between Mrs. Buffett and most investors. While we don’t know the exact amount of her bequest, one can assume she’ll get a cushy nest egg. She can likely afford to take on a little more risk and still live comfortably. Still, this 90/10 allocation drew considerable attention in the investing community. But just how well would such a mix of stocks and bonds hold up in the real world?
 While Berkshire Hathaway guru Warren Buffett said that he wanted his wife's inheritance to be invested 90% in stocks and 10% in bonds, he didn’t say that the 90/10 split makes sense for every investor. 
One Spanish finance professor went to work finding the answer. In a published research paper, Javier Estrada of IESE Business School took a hypothetical $1,000 investment comprised of 90% stocks and 10% short-term Treasuries. Using historical returns, he tracked how the $1,000 would do over a series of overlapping 30-year time intervals. Beginning with the 1900–1929 period and ending with 1985–2014, he collected data on 86 intervals in all.﻿﻿
 
To maintain a more-or-less constant 90/10 split, the funds were rebalanced once a year. In addition, he assumed an initial 4% withdrawal each year, which was increased over time to account for inflation. One of the key metrics Estrada looked for was the failure rate, defined as the percentage of time periods in which the money ran out before 30 years, the length of time some financial planners suggest retirees plan for. As it turned out, Buffett’s aggressive asset mix was surprisingly resilient, “failing” in only 2.3% of the intervals tested.﻿﻿
 
What’s equally surprising is how this portfolio of 90% stocks fared during the five worst time periods since 1900. Estrada found that the nest egg was only slightly more depleted than a much more risk-averse 60% stock and 40% bond allocation.﻿﻿
 
Figure 1. Estrada tested the failure rate of various asset mixes over 86 different historical periods. An asset allocation failed when the funds ran out before 30 years, assuming a fairly typical amount of withdrawals.

As one might expect, the potential gains for such a stock-heavy portfolio surpassed those of more conservative asset mixes. So, not only did the 90/10 allocation do a good job of guarding against downside risk, but it also resulted in strong returns.
 
According to Estrada’s research, the safest asset mix was actually 60% stocks and 40% bonds, which had a remarkable 0% failure rate.﻿﻿ But a portion of stocks any lower than that actually increases your risk, since bonds don’t typically generate enough interest to support retirees who reach an advanced age. 
 
Recent research suggests that retirees might be able to lean heavily on stocks without putting their nest egg in grave danger. But if a 90% stock allocation gives you the jitters, pulling back a little might not be such a bad idea.

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. These numbers are available on the balance sheet of a company’s financial statements.
 
The ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage. The D/E ratio is an important metric used in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly-owned funds. More specifically, it reflects the ability of shareholder equity to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn.
 
The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio.
 
﻿Debt/Equity=Total LiabilitiesTotal Shareholders’ Equity\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \text{Total Liabilities} }{ \text{Total Shareholders' Equity} } \\ \end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=Total Shareholders’ EquityTotal Liabilities​​﻿
 
The information needed for the D/E ratio is on a company's balance sheet. The balance sheet requires total shareholder equity to equal assets minus liabilities, which is a rearranged version of the balance sheet equation:
 
﻿Assets=Liabilities+Shareholder Equity\begin{aligned} &\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Shareholder Equity} \\ \end{aligned}​Assets=Liabilities+Shareholder Equity​﻿
 
These balance sheet categories may contain individual accounts that would not normally be considered “debt” or “equity” in the traditional sense of a loan or the book value of an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by retained earnings/losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand a company’s true leverage.
 
Because of the ambiguity of some of the accounts in the primary balance sheet categories, analysts and investors will often modify the D/E ratio to be more useful and easier to compare between different stocks. Analysis of the D/E ratio can also be improved by including short-term leverage ratios, profit performance, and growth expectations.
 
Business owners use a variety of software to track D/E ratios and other financial metrics. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as D/E ratio and debt ratio.﻿﻿ However, even the amateur trader may want to calculate a company's D/E ratio when evaluating a potential investment opportunity, and it can be calculated without the aid of templates.
 
Given that the debt-to-equity ratio measures a company’s debt relative to the value of its net assets, it is most often used to gauge the extent to which a company is taking on debt as a means of leveraging its assets. A high debt/equity ratio is often associated with high risk; it means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt.
 
If a lot of debt is used to finance growth, a company could potentially generate more earnings than it would have without that financing. If leverage increases earnings by a greater amount than the debt’s cost (interest), then shareholders should expect to benefit. However, if the cost of debt financing outweighs the increased income generated, share values may decline. The cost of debt can vary with market conditions. Thus, unprofitable borrowing may not be apparent at first.
 
Changes in long-term debt and assets tend to have the greatest impact on the D/E ratio because they tend to be larger accounts compared to short-term debt and short-term assets. If investors want to evaluate a company’s short-term leverage and its ability to meet debt obligations that must be paid over a year or less, other ratios will be used.
 
For example, an investor who needs to compare a company’s short-term liquidity or solvency will use the cash ratio:
 
﻿Cash Ratio=Cash+Marketable SecuritiesShort-Term Liabilities \begin{aligned} &\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{ \text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} }{ \text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\ \end{aligned}​Cash Ratio=Short-Term Liabilities Cash+Marketable Securities​​﻿
 
or the current ratio:
 
﻿Current Ratio=Short-Term AssetsShort-Term Liabilities \begin{aligned} &\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{ \text{Short-Term Assets} }{ \text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\ \end{aligned}​Current Ratio=Short-Term Liabilities Short-Term Assets​​﻿
 
instead of a long-term measure of leverage like the D/E ratio.
 
The shareholders' equity portion of the balance sheet is equal to the total value of assets minus liabilities, but that isn’t the same thing as assets minus the debt associated with those assets. A common approach to resolving this issue is to modify the debt-to-equity ratio into the long-term debt-to-equity ratio. An approach like this helps an analyst focus on important risks.
 
Short-term debt is still part of the overall leverage of a company, but because these liabilities will be paid in a year or less, they aren’t as risky. For example, imagine a company with $1 million in short-term payables (wages, accounts payable, and notes, etc.) and $500,000 of long-term debt compared to a company with $500,000 in short-term payables and $1 million in long term debt. If both companies have $1.5 million in shareholder equity then they both have a D/E ratio of 1.00. On the surface, the risk from leverage is identical, but in reality, the second company is riskier.
 
As a rule, short-term debt tends to be cheaper than long-term debt and it is less sensitive to shifting interest rates; the second company’s interest expense and cost of capital is higher. If interest rates fall, long-term debt will need to be refinanced which can further increase costs. Rising interest rates would seem to favor the company with more long-term debt, but if the debt can be redeemed by bondholders it could still be a disadvantage.
 
The debt-to-equity ratio can be applied to personal financial statements as well, in which case it is also known as the personal debt-to-equity ratio. Here, “equity” refers to the difference between the total value of an individual’s assets and the total value of his/her debt or liabilities. The formula for the personal D/E ratio is represented as:
 
﻿Debt/Equity=Total Personal LiabilitiesPersonal Assets−Liabilities\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \text{Total Personal Liabilities} }{ \text{Personal Assets} - \text{Liabilities} } \\ \end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=Personal Assets−LiabilitiesTotal Personal Liabilities​​﻿
 
The personal debt/equity ratio is often used when an individual or small business is applying for a loan. Lenders use the D/E to evaluate how likely it would be that the borrower is able to continue making loan payments if their income was temporarily disrupted.
 
For example, a prospective mortgage borrower is likely to be able to continue making payments if they have more assets than debt if they were to be out of a job for a few months. This is also true for an individual applying for a small business loan or line of credit. If the business owner has a good personal debt/equity ratio, it is more likely that they can continue making loan payments while their business is growing.
 
Gearing ratios constitute a broad category of financial ratios, of which the debt-to-equity ratio is the best example. "Gearing" simply refers to financial leverage. Gearing ratios focus more heavily on the concept of leverage than other ratios used in accounting or investment analysis. This conceptual focus prevents gearing ratios from being precisely calculated or interpreted with uniformity. The underlying principle generally assumes that some leverage is good, but too much places an organization at risk.
 
At a fundamental level, gearing is sometimes differentiated from leverage. Leverage refers to the amount of debt incurred for the purpose of investing and obtaining a higher return, while gearing refers to debt along with total equity—or an expression of the percentage of company funding through borrowing. This difference is embodied in the difference between the debt ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio.
 The real use of debt/equity is comparing the ratio for firms in the same industry—if a company's ratio varies significantly from its competitors, that could raise a red flag. 
When using the debt/equity ratio, it is very important to consider the industry within which the company exists. Because different industries have different capital needs and growth rates, a relatively high D/E ratio may be common in one industry, meanwhile, a relatively low D/E may be common in another. For example, capital-intensive industries such as auto manufacturing tend to have a debt/equity ratio of over 1, while tech firms could have a typical debt/equity ratio around 0.5.﻿﻿
 
Utility stocks often have a very high D/E ratio compared to market averages. A utility grows slowly but is usually able to maintain a steady income stream, which allows these companies to borrow very cheaply. High leverage ratios in slow growth industries with stable income represent an efficient use of capital. The consumer staples or consumer non-cyclical sector tends to also have a high debt to equity ratio because these companies can borrow cheaply and have a relatively stable income.﻿﻿
 
Analysts are not always consistent about what is defined as debt. For example, preferred stock is sometimes considered equity, but the preferred dividend, par value, and liquidation rights make this kind of equity look a lot more like debt. Including preferred stock in total debt will increase the D/E ratio and make a company look riskier. Including preferred stock in the equity portion of the D/E ratio will increase the denominator and lower the ratio. It can be a big issue for companies like real estate investment trusts when preferred stock is included in the D/E ratio.
 
At the end of 2017, Apache Corp (APA) had total liabilities of $13.1 billion, total shareholder equity of $8.79 billion, and a debt/equity ratio of 1.49.﻿﻿ ConocoPhillips (COP) had total liabilities of $42.56 billion, total shareholder equity of $30.8 billion, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.38 at the end of 2017:﻿﻿
 
﻿APA=$13.1$8.79=1.49\begin{aligned} &\text{APA} = \frac{ \$13.1 }{ \$8.79 } = 1.49 \\ \end{aligned}​APA=$8.79$13.1​=1.49​﻿
 
﻿COP=$42.56$30.80=1.38\begin{aligned} &\text{COP} = \frac{ \$42.56 }{ \$30.80 } = 1.38 \\ \end{aligned}​COP=$30.80$42.56​=1.38​﻿
 
On the surface, it appears that APA’s higher leverage ratio indicates higher risk. However, this may be too generalized to be helpful at this stage and further investigation would be needed.
 
We can also see how reclassifying preferred equity can change the D/E ratio in the following example, where it is assumed a company has $500,000 in preferred stock, $1 million in total debt (excluding preferred stock), and $1.2 million in total shareholder equity (excluding preferred stock).
 
The debt-to-equity ratio with preferred stock as part of total liabilities would be as follows:
 
﻿Debt/Equity=$1 million+$500,000$1.25 million=1.25\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \$1 \text{ million} + \$500,000 }{ \$1.25 \text{ million} } = 1.25 \\ \end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=$1.25 million$1 million+$500,000​=1.25​﻿
 
The debt-to-equity ratio with preferred stock as part of shareholder equity would be:
 
﻿Debt/Equity=$1 million$1.25 million+$500,000=.57\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \$1 \text{ million} }{ \$1.25 \text{ million} + \$500,000 } = .57 \\ \end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=$1.25 million+$500,000$1 million​=.57​﻿
 
Other financial accounts, such as unearned income, will be classified as debt and can distort the D/E ratio. Imagine a company with a prepaid contract to construct a building for $1 million. The work is not complete, so the $1 million is considered a liability.
 
Assume that the company has purchased $500,000 of inventory and materials to complete the job that has increased total assets and shareholder equity. If these amounts are included in the D/E calculation, the numerator will be increased by $1 million and the denominator by $500,000, which will increase the ratio.

The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a valuation ratio that compares a company’s stock price to its revenues. It is an indicator of the value that financial markets have placed on each dollar of a company’s sales or revenues.
 
The P/S ratio can be calculated either by dividing the company’s market capitalization by its total sales over a designated period (usually twelve months) or on a per-share basis by dividing the stock price by sales per share. The P/S ratio is also known as a sales multiple or revenue multiple.
 
The price-to-sales ratio is a key analysis and valuation tool for investors and analysts. The ratio shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of sales. Like all ratios, the P/S ratio is most relevant when used to compare companies in the same sector. A low ratio may indicate the stock is undervalued, while a ratio that is significantly above the average may suggest overvaluation.
 
The typical 12-month period used for sales in the price-to-sales ratio is generally the past four quarters (also called trailing 12 months or TTM), or the most recent or current fiscal year (FY). A price-to-sales ratio that is based on forecast sales for the current year is called a forward ratio.
 As is the case with other ratios, the P/S ratio is of greatest value when it is used for comparing companies within the same sector. 
﻿P/S Ratio=MVSSPSwhere:MVS=Market Value per ShareSPS=Sales per Share\begin{aligned} &\text{P/S Ratio}=\frac{MVS}{SPS}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &MVS = \text{Market Value per Share}\\ &SPS = \text{Sales per Share}\\ \end{aligned}​P/S Ratio=SPSMVS​where:MVS=Market Value per ShareSPS=Sales per Share​﻿
 
To determine the P/S ratio, one must divide the current stock price by the sales per share. The current stock price can be found by plugging the stock symbol into any major finance website. The sales per share metric is calculated by dividing a company’s sales by the number of outstanding shares.
 
As an example, consider the quarterly sales for Acme Co. shown in the table below. The sales for fiscal year 1 (FY1) are actual sales, while sales for FY2 are analysts’ average forecasts (assume that we are currently in the first quarter or Q1 of FY2). Acme has 100 million shares outstanding, with the shares presently trading at $10 per share.
 
At the present time, Acme’s P/S ratio on a trailing-12-month basis would be calculated as follows:
 
Acme’s P/S ratio for the current fiscal year would be calculated as follows:
 
If Acme’s peers—which we assume are based in the same sector and are of similar size in terms of market capitalization—are trading at an average P/S ratio (TTM) of 1.5, compared with Acme’s 2.2, it suggests a premium valuation for the company. One reason for this could be the 14.2% revenue growth that Acme is expected to post in the current fiscal year ($520 million versus $455 million), which may be better than what is expected for its peers.
 
Taking that a step further, consider Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) fiscal 2019 revenues of $260.2 billion.﻿﻿ With 17.42 billion in outstanding shares as of June 30, 2020, Apple's sales per share are $14.94.﻿﻿ With its share price at $114.96 as of Sept. 28, 2020, its P/S ratio is 7.7.
 
Meanwhile, Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) trades with a P/S ratio of 6.5, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) at 11.3, suggesting that Apple and Google might be undervalued or Microsoft might be overvalued.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
 
The P/S ratio doesn’t take debt into account. However, the enterprise value-to-sales ratio (EV/Sales) does. The EV/Sales ratio uses enterprise value and not market capitalization like the P/S ratio. Enterprise value adds debt and preferred shares to the market cap and subtracts cash. The EV/Sales ratio is said to be superior, although it involves more steps and isn’t always as readily available.
 
The P/S ratio doesn’t take into account whether the company makes any earnings or whether it will ever make earnings. Comparing companies in different industries can prove difficult as well. For example, companies that make video games will have different capabilities when it comes to turning sales into profits when compared to the likes of grocery retailers.
 
As well, P/S ratios do not account for debt loads or the status of a company’s balance sheet. That is, a company with virtually no debt will be more attractive than a highly levered company with the same P/S ratio.

Companies use the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) to compare a firm's market capitalization to its book value. It's calculated by dividing the company's stock price per share by its book value per share (BVPS). An asset's book value is equal to its carrying value on the balance sheet, and companies calculate it netting the asset against its accumulated depreciation.
 
Book value is also the tangible net asset value of a company calculated as total assets minus intangible assets (patents, goodwill) and liabilities. For the initial outlay of an investment, book value may be net or gross of expenses, such as trading costs, sales taxes, and service charges. Some people may know this ratio by its less common name, price-equity ratio.
 
In this equation, book value per share is calculated as follows: (total assets - total liabilities) / number of shares outstanding). Market value per share is obtained by simply looking at the share price quote in the market.
 
﻿P/B Ratio=Market Price per ShareBook Value per ShareP/B ~Ratio = \dfrac{Market~Price~per~Share}{Book~Value~per~Share}P/B Ratio=Book Value per ShareMarket Price per Share​﻿
 
A lower P/B ratio could mean the stock is undervalued. However, it could also mean something is fundamentally wrong with the company. As with most ratios, this varies by industry. The P/B ratio also indicates whether you're paying too much for what would remain if the company went bankrupt immediately.
 
The P/B ratio reflects the value that market participants attach to a company's equity relative to the book value of its equity. A stock's market value is a forward-looking metric that reflects a company's future cash flows. The book value of equity is an accounting measure based on the historic cost principle and reflects past issuances of equity, augmented by any profits or losses, and reduced by dividends and share buybacks.
 
The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value. The market value of a company is its share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. The book value is the net assets of a company.
 
In other words, if a company liquidated all of its assets and paid off all its debt, the value remaining would be the company's book value. P/B ratio provides a valuable reality check for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price and is often looked at in conjunction with return on equity (ROE), a reliable growth indicator. Large discrepancies between the P/B ratio and ROE often send up a red flag on companies. Overvalued growth stocks frequently show a combination of low ROE and high P/B ratios. If a company's ROE is growing, its P/B ratio should also be growing.
 
It is difficult to pinpoint a specific numeric value of a "good" price-to-book (P/B) ratio when determining if a stock is undervalued and therefore a good investment. Ratio analysis can vary by industry. A good P/B ratio for one industry might be a poor ratio for another.
 
It's helpful to identify some general parameters or a range for P/B value, and then consider various other factors and valuation measures that more accurately interpret the P/B value and forecast a company's potential for growth.
 
The P/B ratio has been favored by value investors for decades and is widely used by market analysts. Traditionally, any value under 1.0 is considered a good P/B for value investors, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors may often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0 as their benchmark.
 
Due to accounting conventions on the treatment of certain costs, the market value of equity is typically higher than the book value of a company, resulting in a P/B ratio above 1. Under certain circumstances of financial distress, bankruptcy or expected plunges in earnings power, a company's P/B ratio can dive below a value of 1.
 
Because accounting principles do not recognize intangible assets such as the brand value, unless the company derived them through acquisitions, companies expense all costs associated with creating intangible assets immediately.
 
For example, companies must expense research and most development costs, reducing a company's book value. However, these R&D outlays can create unique production processes for a company or result in new patents that can bring royalty revenues going forward. While accounting principles favor a conservative approach in capitalizing costs, market participants may raise the stock price because of such R&D efforts, resulting in wide differences between the market and book values of equity.
 
Assume that a company has $100 million in assets on the balance sheet and $75 million in liabilities. The book value of that company would be calculated simply as $25 million ($100M - $75M). If there are 10 million shares outstanding, each share would represent $2.50 of book value. If the share price is $5, then the P/B ratio would be 2x (5 / 2.50). This illustrates that the market price is valued at twice its book value.
 
Closely related to the P/B ratio is the price to tangible book value ratio (PTBV). The latter is a valuation ratio expressing the price of a security compared to its hard, or tangible, book value as reported in the company's balance sheet. The tangible book value number is equal to the company's total book value less than the value of any intangible assets.
 
Intangible assets can be items such as patents, intellectual property, and goodwill. This may be a more useful measure of valuation when the market is valuing something like a patent in different ways or if it is difficult to put a value on such an intangible asset in the first place.
 
Investors find the P/B ratio useful because the book value of equity provides a relatively stable and intuitive metric they can easily compare to the market price. The P/B ratio can also be used for firms with positive book values and negative earnings since negative earnings render price-to-earnings ratios useless, and there are fewer companies with negative book values than companies with negative earnings.
 
However, when accounting standards applied by firms vary, P/B ratios may not be comparable, especially for companies from different countries. Additionally, P/B ratios can be less useful for service and information technology companies with little tangible assets on their balance sheets. Finally, the book value can become negative because of a long series of negative earnings, making the P/B ratio useless for relative valuation.
 
Other potential problems in using the P/B ratio stem from the fact that any number of scenarios, such as recent acquisitions, recent write-offs, or share buybacks, can distort the book value figure in the equation. In searching for undervalued stocks, investors should consider multiple valuation measures to complement the P/B ratio.

Asset/liability management is the process of managing the use of assets and cash flows to reduce the firm’s risk of loss from not paying a liability on time. Well-managed assets and liabilities increase business profits. The asset/liability management process is typically applied to bank loan portfolios and pension plans. It also involves the economic value of equity.
 
The concept of asset/liability management focuses on the timing of cash flows because company managers must plan for the payment of liabilities. The process must ensure that assets are available to pay debts as they come due and that assets or earnings can be converted into cash. The asset/liability management process applies to different categories of assets on the balance sheet.
 
[Important: A company can face a mismatch between assets and liabilities because of illiquidity or changes in interest rates; asset/liability management reduces the likelihood of a mismatch.]
 
A defined benefit pension plan provides a fixed, pre-established pension benefit for employees upon retirement, and the employer carries the risk that assets invested in the pension plan may not be sufficient to pay all benefits. Companies must forecast the dollar amount of assets available to pay benefits required by a defined benefit plan.
 
Assume, for example, that a group of employees must receive a total of $1.5 million in pension payments starting in 10 years. The company must estimate a rate of return on the dollars invested in the pension plan and determine how much the firm must contribute each year before the first payments begin in 10 years.
 
Asset/liability management is also used in banking. A bank must pay interest on deposits and also charge a rate of interest on loans. To manage these two variables, bankers track the net interest margin or the difference between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans.
 
Assume, for example, that a bank earns an average rate of 6% on three-year loans and pays a 4% rate on three-year certificates of deposit. The interest rate margin the bank generates is 6% - 4% = 2%. Since banks are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk that interest rates increase, clients demand higher interest rates on their deposits to keep assets at the bank.
 
An important ratio used in managing assets and liabilities is the asset coverage ratio which computes the value of assets available to pay a firm’s debts. The ratio is calculated as follows:
 
﻿Asset Coverage Ratio=(BVTA−IA)−(CL−STDO)Total Debt Outstandingwhere:BVTA=book value of total assetsIA=intangible assetsCL=current liabilitiesSTDO=short term debt obligations\begin{aligned} &\text{Asset Coverage Ratio} = \frac{ ( \text{BVTA} - \text{IA} ) - ( \text{CL} - \text{STDO}) }{ \text{Total Debt Outstanding} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{BVTA} = \text{book value of total assets} \\ &\text{IA} = \text{intangible assets} \\ &\text{CL} = \text{current liabilities} \\ &\text{STDO} = \text{short term debt obligations} \\ \end{aligned}​Asset Coverage Ratio=Total Debt Outstanding(BVTA−IA)−(CL−STDO)​where:BVTA=book value of total assetsIA=intangible assetsCL=current liabilitiesSTDO=short term debt obligations​﻿
 
Tangible assets, such as equipment and machinery, are stated at their book value, which is the cost of the asset less accumulated depreciation. Intangible assets, such as patents, are subtracted from the formula because these assets are more difficult to value and sell. Debts payable in less than 12 months are considered short-term debt, and those liabilities are also subtracted from the formula.
 
The coverage ratio computes the assets available to pay debt obligations, although the liquidation value of some assets, such as real estate, may be difficult to calculate. There is no rule of thumb as to what constitutes a good or poor ratio since calculations vary by industry.
 
[Fast Fact: Asset/liability management is a long-term strategy to manage risks. For example, a home-owner must ensure that they have enough money to pay their mortgage each month by managing their income and expenses for the duration of the loan.]

Owners and managers of companies are periodically pitched merger and acquisition (M&A) deal proposals. As such, investment bankers, private equity shops, and related companies provide ideas to decision-makers on acquiring another company, merging with a competitor, or being acquired by a financial group or operating company.
 
Analyzing whether a specific M&A deal is a valuable one with long-term growth prospects is a complex undertaking that covers tremendous amounts of information and forecasting. An accretion/dilution analysis helps decision-makers in the M&A process determine whether or not they should proceed with a proposed deal.
 
An accretion/dilution analysis is a simple test, although there is some grunt work required. It is an analysis that answers the question: "Does the proposed deal increase or decrease the post-transaction earnings per share (EPS)?" This determines the justification for the deal in the first place.
 
For companies faced with M&A opportunities, many factors need to be considered, including the global impact of the arrangement, the likelihood of a quick and painless negotiation process, and the compatibility of the merging or acquiring companies. The dealmakers—the front-line workers who spearhead the deals—must address all of these factors in order to successfully broker M&As.
 When pro-forma EPS is neither larger nor smaller than before, then the accretion/dilution analysis is said to breakeven. In this case, other factors would determine whether the M&A deal should proceed. 
An accretion/dilution analysis is often seen as a proxy for whether or not a contemplated deal creates or destroys shareholder value. For instance, if the combined entity has better manufacturing capabilities and more diverse offerings, it may take more than a couple of years to fully integrate both operations to leverage and realize efficiencies, and for marketing to convey the message.
 
An accretion/dilution analysis is not a composite of the complete picture, nor does it contemplate how a newly-combined entity operates, adjusts, or takes advantage of opportunities years down the road.
