Warren Buffett is consistently one of the wealthiest people in the world, coming in with a net worth of $80.8 billion in Oct. 2019. This makes him the third-richest person in the United States.﻿﻿ Buffett keeps his net worth predominantly in Berkshire Hathaway and Berkshire Hathaway stock, the investment company he founded. Berkshire Hathaway acts as his investment vehicle and invests in such things as equities, real estate, and renewable energy.
 
However, Buffett came from modest beginnings, which has shaped the way he views money management. He was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1930, and the town has been his home ever since. Working as an investment salesman, he had a knack for investing and eventually built Berkshire Hathaway into the company it is today. He still lives in the home he purchased in 1958 for $31,500.
 
The majority of Warren Buffett’s wealth is tied up in Berkshire Hathaway’s investment portfolio. Reports from 2004 through 2019 show Buffett’s stock stake as high as 474,998 Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway﻿﻿ and 50,404,853 Class B shares.﻿﻿ In recent years Buffett has been gifting a considerable amount of his shares to charity. His most recent 13-D filings show his stake in class A shares at 259,394 shares and his class B shares at 65,129.﻿﻿ As of March 13, 2020, BRK.A traded at $289,000 and BRK.B traded at $196.40.
 
Buffett's net worth was a mere $1 million when he was in his 30s, consisting largely of Berkshire Hathaway stock. Through smart institutional investments, he increased the company's stock from $7.60 in the 1960s to today's level. This exponential increase in share price is the main driver of Buffett's increase in net worth over the past decades.
 Warren Buffett purchased his first stock at age 11—six shares at $38 each in a company called Cities Service Preferred—which he sold a few years later for $40 per share. 
In addition to acting as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Berkshire Hathaway and being one of its largest shareholders, Buffett uses the company as his main investment vehicle, conducting many of his equity sales and purchases as business transactions. This portfolio makes up the lion's share of his equity investments.
 
The investor is well-known for his income and value approaches to investing, and his portfolio reflects his ideology. As of Dec. 31, 2019, the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio had a value of approximately $242 billion. The portfolio’s greatest weights were in Apple (AAPL), Bank of America Corp (BAC), and Coca-Cola Company (KO). Combined, these three companies totaled 52% of the equity holdings.﻿﻿
