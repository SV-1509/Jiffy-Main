Law is a big service-based business. Business, finance, taxation, litigation, corporate affairs, conflicts, patents, copyrights, antitrust, property, labor, arbitration, as well as administration, political, and social matters all require law expertise. While there are other criteria to rank law firms—such as revenue per partner or lawyer, the number of lawyers, or year-over-year percent growth—annual revenue remains the most accurate, consistent, and easy to follow.
