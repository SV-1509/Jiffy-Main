The AAdvantage Aviator Business Mastercard from Barclaycard offers a large and easily earned one-time miles offer, along with the opportunity to earn AAdvantage miles on every purchase. Card members also enjoy a free checked bag when flying American.
 Earn 65,000 miles after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days. Earn 10,000 miles when a purchase is made on an employee card.

The American Airlines AAdvantage Aviator Business Mastercard best suits business owners who fly American and expect to spend at least $2,000 to $3,000 a month on the card—and are comfortable using their rewards for American flights. Such a spending level would unlock some of the card’s better bonuses: a boost in the miles needed for Elite Status (after spending $25,000 a year) and the opportunity to buy a companion ticket for $99 plus fees and taxes (after spending $30,000 a year). This card is also a good fit for businesses seeking above-average rewards for spending on office supplies and telecom services. (It also offers its best rewards rate for car rentals, but the card’s puzzling absence of rental-car insurance coverage would seem to serve as a deterrent to using it for rental car transactions if another card you carry covers that liability, even if secondary to your primary insurance). 
 
This card offers a bonus of up to 75,000 miles. To earn the full bonus, though, you must meet two conditions.
 
First, you must spend $1,000 in the first 90 days of account opening in order to receive 65,000 miles. Adding at least one employee card to the account, and having the employee use it once, earns you an additional 10,000 miles. 
 
American Airlines uses dynamic pricing for flights so depending on where you book, you may get more or less mileage value. But by our calculations, miles are worth around 2.26 cents on average when used to obtain flights on American. The 75,000 bonus miles you could earn would, then, be worth $1,695 when used to receive awards flights. 
 
Earning miles with this card is straightforward. Here's a quick recap of what you earn with the card:
 
Miles are unlimited and there are no spending caps to heed or bonus categories to activate. In addition to miles on purchases, you'll get 5% of your miles earned for the year as a bonus on your card anniversary. 
 
To qualify for the 2 miles per dollar on American Airlines purchases, you must spend directly with the airline. That means if you book a flight with American through a third-party travel site, you'll only earn 1 point per dollar; the same applies to rental cars and hotels bought through these sites.As with many rewards programs, the miles you earn with the AAdvantage Aviator Business Mastercard technically have an expiration date. But as with those other programs, you can keep your miles and your account active by periodically making a purchase that earns miles or by redeeming miles you already have earned, in this case at least once every 18 months. 
 
When you're ready to redeem rewards, you can do so by calling American Airlines or visiting the airline's website to book award travel. While you can’t transfer miles to other loyalty programs, you can redeem miles for travel on American Airlines, American Eagle and OneWorld partner airlines on flights to nearly 1,000 destinations around the world. 
 
Getting the best value for travel redemptions of course varies by the ticket class you choose. For example, you can book Mile SAAver awards with as little as 12,500 miles or AAnytime award flights with as few as 20,000 miles if you're comfortable with a Main Cabin seat. The minimums for business-class seats in those award categories increase to 15,000 miles and 45,000 miles, respectively, so you'll have to decide what's more important: preserving miles or enjoying the comforts of business class. 
 
Other ways to redeem your AAdvantage miles include:
 
Out of all these options, your best bet in terms of value is redeeming miles for award travel, either with American Airlines or one of its partner airlines. 
 
Making the most of the AAdvantage Aviator Business Mastercard involves using it in a way that, budget permitting, allows you to gain its various bonuses. These two spending scenarios outline what a typical truly small business might earn in rewards, followed by the earnings for a larger and more travel-intensive enterprise. .
 
Assume that you run a business with no employees. You spend $1,000 in the first 90 days to get the 65,000 introductory bonus miles. Then your regular monthly spending totals $1,000 on American Airlines flights, $1,000 on office supplies and telecom services and $1,000 on everyday purchases for your business. 
 
Based on those numbers, you'd earn 24,000 miles a year on flights (12 months x $1,000 = $12,000 on AA purchases x 2 miles per dollar), 24,000 miles on office supplies and telecom (12 months x $1,000 = $12,000 in annual spending x 2 miles per dollar), and 12,000 miles on other spending (12 months x $1,000 = $12,000 in annual spending x 1 miles per dollar) for a total of 60,000 miles per year. The 5% anniversary bonus would bring your miles from spending to 63,000 miles. With the 65,000-mile one-time offer, you'd have 128,000 miles in total. In all, that's $2,893 in travel value, based on our 2.26-cent valuation. And that total does not consider the approximate $350 value of the companion voucher. 
 
Now let’s look at a business in which you and three other employees all hold cards on the account, and travel constantly. You meet the minimum spending requirement to earn the one-time offer of 65,000 miles, and the first employee who gets a card makes at least one purchase so you get the additional 10,000-mile first-year bonus, too.
 
Together, the four of you spend $3,000 per month on American Airlines purchases, $2,000 per month on telecom, office supplies, and car rentals and $4,000 a month on other business purchases. That level of spending would net the business 72,000 miles (12 months x $3,000 = $36,000 on AA purchases x 2 miles per dollar) + 48,000 miles (12 months x $2,000 = $24,000 on telecom etc. purchases x 2 miles per dollar) + 48,000 miles (12 months x $4,000 = $48,000 on telecom etc. purchases x 1 miles per dollar) for a total of 168,000 miles. The 5% miles bonus would earn you another 8,400 miles. Add in both the one-time offer and the one for adding the first card user and your first-year mileage total would come to 251,400 miles. Using the valuation of 2.26 cents each, those miles could be worth as much as $5,682 when used to buy flights on American. This total, too, does not consider the approximate $350 value of the companion voucher.
