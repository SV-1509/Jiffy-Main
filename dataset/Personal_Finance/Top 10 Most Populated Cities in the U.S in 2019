Are you thinking of moving to another city? Perhaps you're even thinking of starting a business in another city. Or maybe you just want to know a few details prior to vacationing in a city you've not visited before. Possibly, you’re just eager to know what makes busy cities tick.
 
Whatever the case may be, below you will find a list of the 10 most populated cities in the United States. This doesn’t mean the city with the most skyscrapers; it means the city with the most people. And, yes, population and development often go hand-in-hand. Population growth and the potential for future economic growth also go hand-in-hand. Population growth (or declines) since 2000 have been included. Also included for each city are median age, median household income, and estimated home/condo values. This makes it easy to see what cities are the most and least affordable.
