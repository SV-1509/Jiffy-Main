BrioDirect Bank is an online bank offering competitive deposit accounts. BrioDirect is the digital offshoot of Sterling National Bank, which was founded in 1888 and is headquartered in New York.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 Low minimum deposit requirements No monthly fees  Hassle-free bank Primarily for deposit accounts  Higher rates for CDs elsewhere  
BrioDirect Bank should appeal to customers who are comfortable banking online and don’t have a need to step into a brick-and-mortar location. It might be a particularly good fit for those who:
 
BrioDirect offers Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-backed deposit accounts for those who want a safe place to stash their savings and earn some interest.
 
BrioDirect Bank’s high-yield savings account has a competitive rate of 0.50% annual percentage yield (APY) (as of October 8, 2020). You won’t have to worry about paying a monthly fee, and you’ll need $25 to get started.
 
While there are no monthly maintenance fees, and the minimum amount to open makes it accessible, there are a few fees if you’re not careful: a $10 fee for withdrawals from your savings that are in excess of six per month and $35 for each overdraft.
 
And while the FDIC protects your money up to $250,000 per account holder, if you’re an existing customer with BrioDirect’s parent bank, Sterling National Bank, you’ll need to consider the fact that the $250,000 is across all your deposit accounts for both banks. For example, if you have a savings and checking account with Sterling National Bank and want to open a savings account and CD with BrioBank, you’ll be covered up to $250,000 for all your accounts. As this is per person, if you share joint accounts with someone, then the covered amount doubles to $500,000.
 
BrioDirect Bank’s high-yield CDs can be an appealing way for you to tuck away savings that you don’t need to touch for a period of time. CDs typically offer higher interest rates than a standard savings or checking account, and you’ll usually find that the longer the term of the CD, the higher the interest rate.
 
BrioDirect offers CDs for anywhere from 30 days to five years, with interest rates that are higher than the national average. The APY starts at 0.05%, and you’ll need a minimum of $500 to open. Should you neglect to fund the account or let the balance fall below $500, your account can be closed after 20 days.
 
Note that BrioDirect Bank’s CDs automatically renew upon maturity. You’ll need to opt to kick the funds over to another account or withdraw them. However, after the CD matures, there is a seven-day grace period for you to do so. Should you need to take money out of your CD before the maturity date, you’ll be hit with an early withdrawal penalty.
 
BrioDirect’s rates for its high-yield CDs are as follows:
