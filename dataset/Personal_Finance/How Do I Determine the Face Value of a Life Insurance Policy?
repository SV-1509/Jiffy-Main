A life insurance policy has a face value and a cash value, and they are two different numbers.
 
The cash value may also be referred to as the net surrender value.
 
To calculate the full benefit that will be paid out to beneficiaries in the event of the insured person's death, consult the schedule of benefits in the policy.
 
Most life insurance companies also offer riders, which are additional benefits that can be included in a plan. For example, some riders stipulate that the face value doubles if the insured dies due to a specific type of accident.
 
Altogether, the face value plus the value of any additional benefits constitute the policy's total death benefit.
 
In most cases, the face value of life insurance is transferred to the beneficiaries tax-free.
 
Face value is one of the most important factors that contribute to the cost of a life insurance policy.
 
For example, a person who seeks to buy a term life insurance policy from Company XYZ would expect to pay more for a $500,000 face value policy than for a $100,000 face value policy.
 
There are many events that can trigger a change up or down in the face value of a policy.
 
On the plus side, the cash value can grow large enough that it actually causes a corresponding increase in the face value of the policy.
 
On the minus side, unpaid loans taken from the policy balance by the policyholder will be deducted from the policy's face value.
 
Any potential change in the face value of the policy will be addressed in the terms of the policy.
 Steve Kobrin, LUTCFThe firm of Steven H. Kobrin, LUTCF, Fair Lawn, NJ The key thing is to determine how big a face value to buy. To calculate it, start off by asking yourself these questions: It may be more cost-effective to use several policies of different face amounts and guarantee periods to cover these various needs. Or, it may be simpler to have one big fat policy to cover everything.
