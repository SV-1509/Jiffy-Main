Any time you sell or exchange capital assets, such as stocks, land and artwork, you must report the transaction on your federal income tax return. In order to do so, you'll need to fill out Form 8949: Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets. You may have gains or losses, the transactions may be short- or long-term, and this information must be broken down to apply the correct tax treatment for the net results.﻿﻿
 
Schedule D of Form 1040 is used to report most capital gain (or loss) transactions.﻿﻿ But before you can enter your net gain or loss on Schedule D, you have to complete Form 8949.
 
The two-page form consists of two parts: Part I for short-term transactions and Part II for long-term transactions. A sale or taxable exchange that occurs more than 12 months from the date the asset was acquired is long-term, while a sale within 12 months or less is short-term.﻿﻿
 
All pages of Form 8949 are available on the IRS website.﻿﻿
 The holding period for capital assets begins the day after the property is received and ends the day of its disposition. 
The form reflects information about transactions you receive on Form 1099-B: Proceeds from Broker and Barter Transactions, as well as from your own records.﻿﻿
 
There are three boxes used to denote whether the transaction was reported to the IRS and how you derived the tax basis for your asset. Typically, the tax basis is your cost, but it may be something else if you received property by gift, inheritance, or in some other way. The three boxes are:
 
You must use a separate Form 8949 for each box you check. So, if you check all three boxes, you report short-term transactions on three separate forms. Each form has space for 14 transactions, so if you have more than 14, you need additional forms.﻿﻿
 
Once the form(s) have been populated, amounts in each column are totaled. The net result is entered on Schedule D as follows:
 
Part II for long-term transactions is a mirror image of Part I for short-term transactions. Again, you need to use a separate Form 8949 for each box checked regarding transactions and basis reported to the IRS.
 
Once the form(s) have been populated, amounts in each column are totaled. The net result is entered on Schedule D as follows:
 Transactions may be combined or listed on separate forms for spouses filing a joint return. 
﻿For each transaction, regardless of whether it's a short-term or long-term transaction, you need to provide seven pieces of information:
 
If you use software to prepare Form 1040 (or you use a paid preparer), information from brokerage firms, mutual funds, and other financial institutions may be transferred to your tax return, saving you the time entering the information and avoiding the possibility of making errors when you input the information.﻿﻿ The software prompts you for the necessary information (your password or other login information) in order for the transactions to be retrieved and reported on your form(s).
 
Reporting capital gains and losses on Form 8949 is not necessarily straightforward. You can find more information about capital gains and losses in IRS Publication 544: Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets.﻿﻿ When in doubt, consult with a tax advisor.
