With a low interest rate, the Navy Federal Platinum card could be a solid option for people who regularly carry a balance or need a credit card for emergencies. However, there’s no guarantee you’ll qualify for its lowest APR, and the card doesn’t offer many other perks to make up for it.
 The Navy Federal Platinum Card is not one of our top-rated balance credit cards. You can review our list of the best balance transfer credit cards for what we think are better options. Low APR if you qualify Zero balance transfer APR Light on fees No rewards on most purchases No guarantee of a low APR Not available to everyone 
If you don’t meet these requirements, you’ll need to look elsewhere, such as your local credit unions, for a similar credit card. 
 
The Navy Federal Platinum card is primarily designed for people who want to take advantage of its low interest rate. If you tend to carry a balance from month to month or need a backup to your emergency savings, this card can be great for that.
 
It can also be useful for balance transfers when you first get the card. 
 
If you want a card for regular use, however, and typically pay your balance in full each month, it may make sense to get a credit card that offers rewards.
