The U.S. Bank FlexPerks Gold American Express card is ideal for those who enjoy travel and want to earn tiered rewards on certain purchases. Because card members earn 3X FlexPoints at restaurants, this card can work well for those who enjoy dining out. Additionally, members earn 2X points on airline purchases and at gas stations. 
 
Travelers who plan to use this card when they purchase airfare and hope to earn points faster by dining out can then turn around and redeem their points later for various rewards. Plus, without a foreign transaction fee to worry about, the card can be a good choice for use when traveling abroad.
 
Additionally, this card can be good for those who like extra perks like complimentary Wi-Fi and access to benefits like concierge, shopping and experiences. This card offers access to American Express CONNECT which offers extra dining experiences and provides entertainment perks, along with other services. If you want a few extra perks for a reasonable annual fee, this card can be a good choice.
 
For those who prefer straight cash back, however, this card might not be the best choice. While it’s possible to redeem for statement credit, other cards might provide cash back alternatives. The Capital One Savor card, for example, offers 4% cash back on dining and entertainment and 2% cash back at grocery stores. The annual fee is $95 (waived for the first year). This is a comparable card that offers a slightly different reward earning potential.
 
Receive 30,000 bonus FlexPoints when you spend $2,000 on eligible purchases in the first four months of card membership. This bonus is worth $450 when redeemed for airfare, car rentals, hotels and other items. 
 
The one-time offer is reasonable when compared with other cards. The Capital One Savor offers a $300 cash back bonus, but you have to spend $3,000 in the first three months. The Chase Sapphire Preferred card, which has an annual fee of $95, offers 60,000 bonus points, but you have to spend $4,000 in three months to get the bonus. And, while it’s worth more ($750 when redeemed for travel), it’s harder to earn.
 
For the relatively small spending requirement and the longer time you have to meet the threshold, the bonus offered by the U.S. Bank FlexPerks Gold American Express credit card is very reasonable.
 
Earn FlexPoints on a tiered basis:
 
Rewards can be redeemed through the FlexPerks website for a number of different rewards. Some of the items included in redemption include:
 
Rewards redeemed for travel are worth about 1.5 cents apiece. However, redemption values might vary, depending on what you end up getting. Use the FlexPerks website to see what you end up with in terms of redemption values.
 
There are no transfer partners available with the U.S. Bank FlexPerks Gold American Express card. This card does not earn Amex Membership points. FlexPoints, while they can be redeemed for travel, can’t be transferred to other loyalty programs.
 
The best way to maximize your rewards with the U.S. Bank FlexPerks Gold American Express card is to use it to make purchases at restaurants for the enhanced rewards earnings on dining. You can also maximize your rewards by getting 2X points on gas station and airline purchases. If you travel a lot or eat out a lot, this card can help you maximize points. 
 
In fact, in 2018, the average consumer spent $3,459 on food away from home. That’s 10,377 FlexPoints—or about $155 in terms of travel redemptions. That’s more than enough to offset the annual fee. With other spending added in, there’s a possibility of earning even more and maximizing your rewards further.
