The best U.S. Bank credit cards provide compelling cash back, points, or miles, with consumer-friendly terms like no annual fees (or annual fees that are easily justified based on rewards), introductory interest rates, and one-time bonuses. U.S. Bank has cards for multiple market segments, offering rewards for consumers and small-business owners interested in travel or cash-back redemptions. We reviewed the most popular consumer and business credit cards offered by U.S. Bank and chose the ones below as the best for various categories, depending on your needs.
 Earn 25,000 bonus points worth $250. Just spend $1,000 within the first 90 days of account opening. 
The U.S. Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature Card is our choice for the best overall card and best no-annual-fee travel card from U.S. Bank because of its outstanding bonus rewards for dining, groceries, gas, and streaming services, with 1 point per dollar on all other spending. The lack of an annual fee and the broad redemption options, including travel, make this an excellent primary or secondary card to consider.
 Starting with an enrollment bonus of 50,000 points worth $750 on travel. Just spend $4,500 in the first 90 days of account opening. 
We selected the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite Card as U.S. Bank's best travel card because of its triple bonus points on all travel purchases as well as mobile wallet spending. There is a substantial $400 annual fee, but that should be justified with focused use for travel spending along with using the card for everyday purchases. The generous one-time bonus, worth $750 based on our valuation of 1.5 cents per point when redeemed for travel, is available after $5,000 in spending within the first three months of account opening.
 Earn $500 cash back after you spend $4,500 in eligible net purchases on the Authorized Owner's card in the first 150 days of opening your account. 
We chose the U.S. Bank Business Cash Rewards World Elite Mastercard as the best business card option from U.S. Bank due to its generous 3% bonus cash-back rewards on popular business spending categories, such as gas, office supply stores, and cell phone services. There is also a 25% bonus on cash back earned the previous year, up to $250 each year. Those features combined with no annual fee make this a solid card option for small-business owners.
 Earn a $200 bonus after you apply online and spend $500 in eligible net purchases within the first 90 days of account opening. 
U.S. Bank Cash + Visa Signature is our pick for best U.S. Bank cash-back card option due to its lucrative cash back promotional structure, which includes an exceptional 5% bonus on two spending eligible categories of choice on the first $2,000 in spending each quarter along with 2% back on an eligible everyday category and 1% on all other purchases. Used as a primary card the Cash + Visa Signature card can create a bespoke earnings experience for the savvy cash back consumer seeking to optimize credit card rewards on their personal spending.
 30,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 within the first 90 days 
The SKYPASS Visa Secured is the highest scoring secured card option from U.S. Bank, featuring an airline mile rewards structure, which is highly unusual for a secured card designed for those with no credit or bad credit, of 1 mile per dollar in spending for redemption on Korean Air or transfer to one of Korean Air's U.S. domestic or international partners. There is a $50 annual fee but that can be justified with sufficient spending and redemption of rewards for travel.
 
U.S. Bank can trace its roots back to the time of the Civil War, when First National Bank of Cincinnati opened for business in 1863. After numerous mergers and acquisitions during the 20th century and turn of the 21st century, including U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, First National Bank of Minnesota, and Firstar Corporation, the current U.S. Bancorp was formed. Headquarterd in Minneapolis, U.S. Bank is the fifth-largest banking organization in the nation, with more than 70,000 employees and $495 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2019. In terms of its credit card portfolio's total outstanding balances, U.S. Bank currently ranks sixth largest in the country.
 
U.S. Bank primarily issues Visa cards but also has a few products issued through the American Express and Mastercard networks. It does not issue any cards on the Discover network.
 
U.S. Bank requires good to excellent credit for the majority of its consumer and business cards, although it does consider applicants with no credit history or lower credit scores for its non-rewards and secured card options.
 
U.S. Bank rewards points are earned at various levels based on the card product. Cash back is generally earned as a flat percentage back on purchases, with a few card options that provide enhanced bonus cash back on certain spending categories. U.S. Bank Altitude and FlexPerks points are generally earned at a points multiple for certain purchase categories and a base rate for all other spending. Points can be redeemed for travel, merchandise, gift cards, or cash back through the U.S. Bank Altitude and FlexPerks rewards portals.
 
U.S. Bank received a score of 785 out of 1,000 points in the 2019 J.D. Power U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study, placing it in the bottom third of national credit card issuers. The average score among major issuers was 806.
 
In order to track and assess the U.S. domestic credit card market, we gather scores of data points on nearly 300 cards. This data is collected manually from both card-issuer websites and publicly available sources. 
 
To ensure that our information is as up-to-date as possible, we deploy automated tools that monitor changes in such key data as annual percentage rates, introductory rates, introductory periods, bonus offers, rewards earnings rates, fees, and card benefits. We then rapidly make any needed updates to our card listings, reviews, and recommendations so that readers have the most reliable information and advice. 
 
Once we collect credit card data we organize it in our database according to features, which roll up into feature sets (such as rewards, interest, fees, benefits, and security/customer service). Each individual card feature is assigned a star rating score on a 1 to 5 scale, using a prescribed formula. For instance, for a one-time bonus score we would use a formula like: If bonus is $500 or greater, then assign a score of 5; if $300-$499, then 4; and so forth. 
 
Once all of a card’s features have received a score we apply a weighting factor to each feature to arrive at a weighted average score for the card (according to the general category in which it resides, such as travel rewards). 
 
This weighting process allows us to assign significantly more emphasis to the attributes important to a particular category and downplay those that are less relevant to it. That lets us objectively identify cards that stand out in their category and indicate why they do. For example, with travel rewards cards we apply significantly more weight to such travel-specific features as airport lounge access or primary rental car insurance than we do to attributes such as interest rates or fees that might be more strongly considered for other categories, such as balance-transfer cards.
 
Another critical factor we consider when rating and ranking travel cards and other types of rewards cards is the cards’ effective earnings rates. We first calculate the average value of points or miles for all the rewards cards in our database, a painstaking process that entails collecting all airline fare data by carrier across scores of popular domestic and international city-pairs along with per-night hotel charges at all major hotel brands.
