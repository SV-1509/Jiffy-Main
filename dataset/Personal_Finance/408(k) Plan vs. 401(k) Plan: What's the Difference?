Both 408(k) and 401(k) refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code that outline employer-sponsored retirement plans. Both provide guidelines that allow employees to set aside a portion of their paychecks before taxes are taken out to be invested in a special account meant for retirement. That's where these two alphanumeric codes diverge. While 401(k)s have become synonymous with a widely available retirement savings vehicle, 408(k)s set the guidelines for what is more commonly known as the simplified employee pension or SEP IRA.﻿﻿
 
According to the IRS, "SEPs were authorized by Congress in 1978 to provide employers with a simpler, less complicated manner of providing retirement benefits for themselves and their employees. Section 408(k)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code defines a SEP as an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity with respect to certain participation, contribution, discrimination, and withdrawal requirements being met."﻿﻿
 
Employers may contribute to SEP IRAs even when the employee is also the employer. Employers may make tax-deductible contributions on behalf of eligible employees—including the business owner—to their SEP IRAs. The employer is allowed a tax deduction for plan contributions that do not exceed the statutory limit.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
 
A 401(k) is the most common type of retirement savings account offered.﻿﻿ It is a qualified, employer-sponsored savings plan. Employers offering a 401(k) plan may make matching or non-elective contributions to the plan on behalf of eligible employees and may also add a profit-sharing feature to the plan. Earnings in a 401(k) plan accrue on a tax-deferred basis.
 401(k) plans are slightly more complex than 408(k)s, as they generally contain numerous investment options chosen by the employer. With a SEP IRA, employees choose their own investments. 
Essentially, what differentiates the 408(k) SEP IRA from the 401(k) is that it's only available to companies with 25 or fewer employees. Here are some other distinguishing features.﻿﻿
