Student loan repayment options offer borrowers some flexibility in repaying education debt. With federal student loans, you have multiple repayment paths to choose from. If you borrowed private student loans, however, your options may be more limited. The right and best way for you to pay depends largely on which type of loans you owe, how much you have to pay back, and where you are financially after graduation. This guide explores everything you need to know when creating your student loan repayment plan.
 
Altogether, there are eight repayment plans you can choose from if you borrowed federal student loans. Here's how they compare. One note: So far, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has rejected the majority of applicants, so be forewarned that choosing a repayment plan that is a good option for the program doesn't guarantee your loans will be forgiven.

 The PAYE, REPAYE, IBR, and ICR plans all offer forgiveness for remaining loan balances after a set period of time. But, these forgiven amounts may be treated as taxable income, which could potentially raise your tax bill. 
The answer to this question is different for every borrower and it's important to consider what you need most from your payoff plan and what you can realistically afford.
 
"Student loan repayment isn't one size fits all, but the majority of people just try to pay back their debt normally," says Shann Grewal, vice president of IonTuition. "When borrowers don't look for a repayment plan that best fits their situation, it has outside impacts."
 
Your choice of plan can affect other financial decisions you make. If you commit, for example, to a Standard Repayment plan based on the salary you're making at your first job after college, that could influence your future career path if you decide to stay put until the loans are paid off. Your loans may be zeroed out, but in the meantime, you could miss out on chances to increase your salary or advance yourself professionally.
 
It's also important to keep income-driven repayment plans and their usefulness in perspective. Whether to choose an income-driven repayment plan can hinge on several factors, including what you're earning now and your future earning potential.
 
"Some students will enter the workforce immediately with a high-paying job, while others will be required to work their way up," says Lena Chukhno, general manager of student loan refinancing at Earnest. Other variables that come into play include the amount of debt owed and whether you plan to go back to school for a graduate degree at some point.
 
Chukhno says what's realistic for one student may not be for another, and it's important to consider long-term goals when making a student loan repayment plan. "You can always refinance your loan down the line if the situation changes, but it's best to start off on the right note so you don't get into financial trouble."
 Eligibility for PAYE, REPAYE, IBR, and ICR isn't guaranteed from year to year. Your eligibility and payments are recalculated yearly, based on your family size and household income. 
Private student loans typically offer fewer choices for borrowers. These include:
 
Depending on your lender, you may be eligible for a deferment or forbearance period if you're not able to keep up with your regular loan payments. But this typically requires a financial hardship and it isn't offered by every lender.
 
If you have private student loans, it's important to do the math so you know what the various repayment options will cost you in interest over the life of the loan. You might also consider refinancing your private loans if it would allow you to get a lower interest rate. This can save you money on interest during the repayment term. Refinancing student loans typically involves a credit check, so if you don't have a solid credit history yet, you may need a cosigner to qualify. Staying in touch with your lender is important, especially if you're struggling to manage your monthly payments.
 
If you owe education debt, take time to get to know your student loan repayment options. Ideally, this is something you do before graduation so you have an idea of which repayment plan you want to start with. If you're choosing an income-driven plan, be aware of the potential tax consequences and reevaluate your finances each year to see if another repayment option might be better for saving money on interest charges.
