WebBank is an online-only bank that offers above average rates on a couple of select deposit products. Founded in 1997 in Salt Lake City, this Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)–insured state chartered bank is known more for its brand partnerships, where it serves as the issuer for many popular lending and credit solutions.

WebBank is a good fit for customers who want a place online to set aside money and forget about it for a while, so it earns interest long term. It could be a good fit for customers who:
 
WebBank offers limited personal banking products and services directly to consumers. Much of the bank’s business lies in its partnerships with other financial companies. WebBank deposit accounts are limited to two options:
 
All WebBank accounts are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 per depositor.
 
WebBank offers one savings account: a high-yield online savings account. A minimum deposit of $1,000 is required to open a savings account through WebBank. The account has a decent interest rate, currently set at 0.85% APY. While its rate is lower than the best high-yield savings accounts around, it’s still competitive with what’s offered by many online banks and far superior to the national average of 0.06%.﻿﻿
 
Interest on WebBank’s savings accounts compounds daily. You’ll earn slightly more than you would on an account that compounds monthly. The difference is minuscule with smaller balances, but it is much more noticeable with a larger balance in the account. WebBank doesn’t charge a monthly maintenance fee on its savings account, although there is a $5 charge for paper monthly statements.
 
The other type of account available from WebBank is its CDs, which the bank refers to as “time deposits.”
 
WebBank’s time deposits require a minimum deposit of $2,500 and come in five terms, ranging from six months to five years. Most terms currently earn a 0.55% APY, which is much lower than the best CD rates on the market.
 
Customers are subject to early withdrawal penalties if they withdraw funds before they reach maturity. Here’s a list of early withdrawal penalties, which are based on your time deposit term length.
 
Once a time deposit reaches maturity, WebBank customers have 10 days to withdraw funds without a penalty.
 
Besides its own personal banking products, WebBank also partners with several well-known financial companies to offer a variety of loans, credit cards, and other financing options to consumers. These products aren't available directly through WebBank, but it is the issuer for them. WebBank brand partners include:
