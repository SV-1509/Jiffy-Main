  SunTrust 
Our Take
 
While SunTrust—now known as Truist—was a top choice for borrowers who needed private student loans to pay for school, especially for international students, the lender discontinued its private loan program on May 31, 2020. However, Truist will continue to provide resources on its existing loans.
 Very competitive interest rates Extra discounts and rewards Options for international students Not available to borrowers in all states Limits on how much you can borrow Short repayment terms for graduate and MBA students  SunTrust As of May 31, 2020, SunTrust discontinued its private student loan program and is no longer accepting loan applications.﻿﻿﻿ 
For undergraduate and graduate students with established credit histories or that have a co-signer, SunTrust may be a good choice for private student loans with their low-interest rates and up to 0.75% interest rate discounts.
 
Before taking out any student loan, it's wise to shop around and look at multiple lenders, including federal options, to find the best rates and terms. Depending on your credit, you could be eligible for low-interest loans that can make college more affordable.
 
SunTrust isn’t available to all borrowers, and it does limit how much you can take out each year. Here’s what else you need to know before applying for a SunTrust student loan.
 
SunTrust has four student options for undergraduate and graduate borrowers. Notably, SunTrust does not offer parent student loans. 
 BB&T Corporation and SunTrust Bank merged in December 2019 to form Truist﻿﻿. 
The Custom Choice Loans is for undergraduate and graduate borrowers enrolled at least half time attending an approved school. How it stands out from SunTrust’s other loans is that you have more options. You can decide to defer payments until you graduate, or you can make payments while you’re in school. You can also choose which loan term works for you: seven, 10, or 15 years. 
 
A unique perk of the Custom Choice Loan is the graduation reward. When you graduate, the principal of your loan balance will be reduced by 2%. For example, if you had a $20,000 student loan and graduated, your loan balance would be reduced by $400. There are no application fees, origination fees, or prepayment penalties.﻿﻿
 
Like the Custom Choice Loan, SunTrust’s Start Student Loan is for undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at least half time. What makes the Start Student Loan unique is that borrowers get a 0% APR for the first six months after their loan is disbursed. During that time no interest will accrue on your loan, helping you save money. Once that introductory period expires, your approved interest rate will apply. 
 
The Start Student Loan has only one repayment term—15 years—and one repayment option. Your payments are deferred while you’re in school, though you can make extra payments if you wish.﻿﻿
 
SunTrust’s Union Federal Private Student Loan is also for undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at least half time. However, it’s the only one of SunTrust’s student loans available to international students.
 
The Union Federal Private Student Loan has four different repayment options: 
 
The Union Federal Private Student Loan is eligible for SunTrust’s on-time payment benefit, on top of automatic payment and SunTrust customer discounts. If you sign up for automatic payments, make them from a SunTrust account, and make all of them on time for 36 months, you can reduce your interest rate by 0.75%.﻿﻿
 
SunTrust’s Graduate Business School Loan is designed for students enrolled at least half time in a graduate or professional degree program. To be eligible, the student must attend a school accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Business Schools.
 
This loan can be a cost-effective alternative to federal Grad PLUS Loans, which have an interest rate of 7.08%. If you have good credit or a cosigner who does—and if you qualify or SunTrust’s interest rate discounts—you could get a significantly lower rate with a Graduate Business School Loan.
 
The Graduate Business School Loan has four repayment options: 
 
Upon graduation, you could qualify for a 1% principal reduction.﻿﻿
 
To qualify for a private student loan from SunTrust, you must meet the following requirements:
 
Unfortunately, SunTrust does not offer a prequalification tool. To find out if you qualify for a loan, you have to complete the application and go through a hard credit inquiry, which will temporarily affect your credit score. 
 
SunTrust does not charge application or origination fees, and there are no prepayment penalties if you decide to pay off your loan ahead of schedule. However, SunTrust does charge a late fee if you miss your payment due date. 
 
SunTrust offers two discounts to all loan borrowers: 
 
The Union Federal Private Student Loan is also eligible for an on-time payment discount. If you make all of your payments on time for 36 months, you’ll lower your interest rate by another 0.25%. If you take advantage of all three discounts, you could lower your rate by 0.75%. 
 
The repayment options available to you are dependent on what type of loan you have. Custom Choice, Union Federal, and Graduate Business loans provide these four repayment options: 
 
The Start Student Loan, however, only has the in-school deferment option.﻿﻿
 
Some of SunTrust’s loans offer special rewards. 
 
SunTrust does not require borrowers to have a co-signer when they apply. However, if you don’t meet the income or credit requirements on your own, you may not get approved for a loan. You better your chances of qualifying for a loan—and securing a competitive interest rate—by adding a co-signer to your application. Depending on the type of loan you have, you can apply for a co-signer release after making 36 to 48 monthly payments on time. 
 
On its website, Suntrust encourages borrowers who experience financial hardships to call its loan servicer—American Education Services—to discuss repayment options. You may be eligible for an alternative payment plan, where you only make payments on the interest on your loan for 12 to 24 months. You may also be eligible for a temporary deferment, which allows you to postpone payments altogether. You can call the loan servicer at 800-233-0557. 
 
If the student borrower dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled, SunTrust will forgive the remaining balance of the loan.﻿﻿ 
 
The application itself only takes about 15 minutes to complete. Once finished, you’ll receive an instant credit decision. Then you’ll have to submit additional documentation online, by fax, or through the mail. You’ll be prompted to sign a loan packet, and SunTrust will reach out to your school to certify the loan.
 
Once the school certifies the loan, SunTrust will contact you with a final loan disclosure. You have three days to cancel if you no longer want the loan. If you miss that deadline, the loan will be disbursed to the school. The entire process can take several weeks, so be sure to apply well in advance.﻿﻿ 
 
SunTrust only offers in-school refinancing, and it’s only for existing private student loans. If you have federal student loans or have already graduated, you are not eligible for refinancing through SunTrust. If you’d like to refinance your loans, check out our best student loan refinancing companies. 
 
SunTrust’s student loans are serviced by American Education Services (AES). Unfortunately, many borrowers have had issues with AES.
 
In the 2019 Annual Report of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Private Education Loan Ombudsman, the CFPB listed the number of complaints it received about different private lenders. From Sept. 1, 2018, to Aug. 31, 2019, it received 2,900 complaints about private student loan lenders. Of those, 180—or about 7%—were about AES.﻿﻿
 
However, you can reach customer support by phone. Which number you should call is dependent on the type of loan you’re interested in.﻿﻿ 
 
Before applying for any private student loan, make sure you complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). It’s what the federal government and your school use to determine your eligibility for financial aid, including grants and federal student loans. If you need additional funding, then you can proceed with your SunTrust student loan application.
 
To apply, you’ll need to provide the following information: 
 SunTrust was previously an excellent choice for people looking for supplemental loans for their education. However, the lender ended its loan program, so it’s no longer an option for private student loans, and you’ll have to find another lender.
