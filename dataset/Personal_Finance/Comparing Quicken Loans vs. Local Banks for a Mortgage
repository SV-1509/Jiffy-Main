Since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, online mortgage companies have become an increasingly significant force in the home loan industry.﻿﻿ Leading the charge is Quicken Loans, now the largest retail mortgage lender in the country.﻿﻿ 
 
Does the growth of players like Quicken Loans, which offers an automated approval process through its Rocket Mortgage platform, mean web-based firms have more to offer than your community bank down the street? Not necessarily. Where you go for a loan is largely a matter of what is comfortable for you—and where you can get the best rates.
 
Both types of lenders offer mortgage pre-approval. Being pre-approved can sometimes help you have your offer on a home accepted. However, they have other significant differences that could shape which one you find preferable.
 
Going with an online lender has certain benefits, especially if you are someone who likes to feel in control of the loan process. The advantages of going with a company such as Quicken Loans include:
 
When it comes to big financial decisions, some people just feel more at ease doing business in person. With Quicken Loans, you are talking to someone working out of a call center that might be in a different part of the country.
 If you are the type of person who likes to look people in the eye when getting advice, a local lender might be the best way to go. 
Other advantages of going with a brick-and-mortar provider include:
