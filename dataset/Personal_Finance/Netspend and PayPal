Even if you don't use it, everyone has heard of PayPal. The company's been around since the late 1990s, and has undergone a few name changes before getting its current moniker. PayPal went public in 2002, when it began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol PYPL. Shares were priced at $13 each, with the initial public offering (IPO) raising more than $61 million. Since then, the company has undergone a number of changes, including being acquired and spun off by eBay, as well as a series of different acquisitions.
 
But one thing that hasn't really changed, though. That's the fact that the company is still one of the world's leading online payment systems. According to the company's website, there are 277 million active PayPal account holders who use the service online, through the app, or on their mobile devices. PayPal has made this easy by partnering with different companies around the world including Netspend.
 
Prepaid Netspend accounts work with PayPal. A PayPal account can be linked to a Netspend account, and vice versa. PayPal allows its customers to add money to their PayPal prepaid cards at Netspend Reload Network locations nationwide. Read on to find out more about Netspend and how the process works.
 
Netspend is a U.S. corporation that offers prepaid debit Visa and MasterCards to about 68 million consumers across the country. Users can use their cards anywhere Visa and MasterCard is accepted, pay bills, and transfer funds to others using their cards.
 
Netspend also offers gift cards that cannot be replenished and travel cards that can be reloaded for a certain number of times. Existing customers can also open savings accounts in conjunction with the Netspend prepaid debit cards.
 
Users can reload their Netspend debit cards with cash, which generally costs a $3.95 fee. Reloading can also be done with funds from bank accounts and other financial service providers, such as PayPal. Netspend prepaid cardholders can also have their paychecks, tax refunds, and other benefits such as Social Security deposited directly to their accounts.
 
While PayPal also offers its own line of MasterCard prepaid cards, it cooperates closely with other debit card providers like Netspend. PayPal allows its customers to replenish their prepaid card balances at more than 100,000 Netspend Reload Network locations nationwide. Netspend Reload locations are typically available at participating grocery stores, gas stations, check-cashing stores, and MoneyGram, and Western Union locations.
 PayPal customers can replenish their prepaid card balances at Netspend Reload Network locations nationwide. 
Likewise, Netspend cardholders can use PayPal to replenish their cards. This requires the user to link both accounts together. In order to link the card, users must log on to the PayPal website, click the wallet tab, and click on the link a card or bank tab. After that, users click on the link a debit or credit card tab, fill in their card information, and click the link card button. PayPal may require verification to confirm the card.
 
In this case, PayPal does not charge NetSpend customers fees, and funds added to Netspend accounts are typically available within two to three business days.
 
PayPal also has special offers and cash back rewards on its prepaid MasterCard cards that are sponsored by Netspend. PayPal sends reward offers based on their prepaid cardholders' shopping habits.
