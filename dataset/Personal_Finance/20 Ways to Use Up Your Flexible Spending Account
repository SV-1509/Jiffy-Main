If you have a flexible spending account (FSA)⁠—there are two kinds: one for health and medical expenses and one for dependent care expense—the end of the year means you’re likely up against a use-it-or-lose-it scenario. It’s possible that your company might offer you a rollover of $500 or a grace period in which to use up your leftover funds, though it can’t offer both.
 
If you have both FSAs for dependents and one for health and medical, it is a good idea to be aware that you can only spend each fund in its category. With luck (and planning), you have carefully calculated your dependent care expenses and don't have any extra funds in that FSA. If you do, they can only be spent on dependent care.
 
You're more likely to have cash left in your healthcare fund, though, since those expenses are more difficult to plan for. Before the end of the year runs out, make it a priority to use those FSA funds before they’re gone forever.
 
Start by contacting your FSA provider and finding out how much is left in your account. Here are 20 ways to use up any remaining funds.
 If you have both FSAs for dependents and for health and medical, it is a good idea to be aware that you can only spend each fund in its category. 
According to IRS Publication 969, you can only spend FSA money on “qualified medical expenses.” (Here's an IRS list.) Generally, services you receive that involve a healthcare professional qualify, but there are some others, too. If you need help coming up with ideas, maybe a few of these will help. 
 
During the year you probably spent more than you thought on expenses that fall under the rules of your FSA. If you can document those expenses, you may not have to try to spend money on things you don’t necessarily need right now.
