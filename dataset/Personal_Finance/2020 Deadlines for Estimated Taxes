While individuals who work for companies traditionally have taxes withheld from their paychecks, independent contractors and those who subsist on investment income should proactively pay estimated taxes. Payments are typically made incrementally, on the following quarterly deadlines:
 
The tax filing and payment extension due to the coronavirus outbreak has changed these deadlines for 2020. Estimated tax payment 1, usually due on April 15, is now due on July 15. So is estimated tax payment 2. ﻿﻿
 
If a due date falls on a weekend or legal holiday, payments must be issued on the next business day.﻿﻿ This caused some 2019 dates to fall a bit later than the 15th of the month, but that is not the case for 2020.
 
Bear in mind that those who file for personal income tax extensions must still adhere to the quarterly payment deadlines. Furthermore, even though you may pay the first installment of estimated taxes for 2020 on the same day as you file your 2019 tax return, these are entirely separate actions.
 
Those who project their 2020 tax bill to be under $1,000, after taking into account any withholding and refundable tax credits such as earned income credits and premium tax credits, do not need to bother with estimated taxes.﻿﻿ All others should employ one of the following two approaches.
 
Employed individuals should increase withholding by filing a new Form W-4 with their employers.﻿﻿ Those receiving pension or annuity income should file Form W-4P with the plan administrators or other parties who pay out the benefits.﻿﻿ Individuals may opt for voluntary withholding on such payments as Social Security benefits and unemployment benefits by filing Form W-4V.﻿﻿
 
It can be difficult to project total taxes at the start of the year. Fortunately, the following safe harbor provisions can help individuals avoid penalties for inaccuracy:
 
If your income changes dramatically during the year, you can adjust the remaining estimated tax payments accordingly. For example, if you lose your job mid-year you may reduce the rest of your estimated tax payments for 2020 to avoid or minimize overpayment.
 
When using 2019's tax bill to project 2020's liability, take the following adjustments into account:
 
While estimating taxes isn't an exact science, coming close to the correct amount will help individuals avoid penalties if they're mindful of the quarterly deadlines. Finally, it's important to consult tax professionals when questions about difficult issues arise.
