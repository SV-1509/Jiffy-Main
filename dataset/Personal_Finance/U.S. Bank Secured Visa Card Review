The U.S. Bank Secured Visa card is aimed at those looking to establish or build credit. The security deposit is kept in an interest-bearing savings account, and credit tools help cardholders track their progress.
 The U.S. Bank Secured Visa® Card is not one of our top rated secured credit cards. You can review our list of the best secured credit cards for what we think are better options. Security deposit placed in interest-bearing account Maximum credit line of $5,000 Free credit score Annual fee No rewards program Credit line tied directly to the security deposit 
The U.S. Bank Secured Visa card is likely to work well for someone who wants a higher credit line as they work to build their credit. If you have a large amount of cash that you can use as a security deposit, you can get a much higher credit line than you might typically get with other secured cards.
 
Additionally, tools like auto pay and access to your TransUnion credit score will help you stay on track. 
 
This card may also be attractive to those who haven’t been able to qualify for an unsecured card. However, if you’re hoping to earn rewards while building credit, the Discover it Secured card might be a better choice.
