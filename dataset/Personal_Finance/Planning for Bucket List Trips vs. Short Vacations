Saving up for a bucket list trip takes time – in some cases, lots of time. In the meanwhile, you still need to be able to take a break occasionally. Fortunately, it’s possible to spend a few days at Walt Disney World or a weekend at a nearby bed-and-breakfast while putting money aside for that African safari you have always dreamed about. Doing so involves is establishing a budget, setting priorities and taking advantage of a few creative strategies to help you save enough to do it all.
 
First things first. Where do you want to go for your bucket list trip? Is it French Polynesia, Paris, Hawaii or somewhere else? Ask yourself the same question about those weekend getaways or short vacations. Make a list of bucket list destinations and short vacations using search engines like Expedia, Kayak or Travelocity to help you determine the basic cost of travel, lodging, activities and food for each option.
 
Decide how much you can comfortably save each month. This amount will be distributed between two savings accounts – one for your bucket list trip and the other for short vacations. How you distribute the funds will depend on the cost of your bucket list trip and how soon you want to take it.
 
For example, if your desired bucket list trip is 14 days in Hawaii at a cost of $4,800 for two people and your monthly travel savings budget is $300, you would need to dedicate $200 of your monthly savings to Hawaii in order to have the total saved in two years. In the meantime, putting the remaining $100 in your short-trip fund would give you $1,200 per year for weekend getaways or one or two short trips per year.
 
Saving for vacation involves setting realistic goals. If the bucket list trip you want to take is too expensive for your vacation savings budget, you may need to pick another bucket list trip or tweak the one you can’t live without. This could involve shortening the stay, forgoing some entertainment options or going at a less expensive time of the year. Once all the kinks are ironed out, set up a separate savings account for your bucket list trip and another for annual travel. Now it’s up to you to stick to your savings plan no matter what.
 
Look for cost-saving opportunities as part of the planning process for your trips. This includes finding deals on travel websites such as Groupon, Airfarewatchdog, Booking.com and Expedia. Sign up for email alerts from these and others including travel companies and airlines, especially those that have flash sales. Note when offseason rates apply and what they are in case that time of year is appealing to you. In most cases, booking well in advance gives you the best rate although sometimes last-minute deals can also be found. Don’t forget to book hotel rooms that include free breakfast for a hot meal in the morning and fresh fruit and coffee to take with you if you are driving.
 
The following ideas and tips can help you maximize the amount you save and ensure your savings plan will be successful.
 
The savings don’t have to stop once you leave for vacation. Here are some ways to save that can help you cut costs on the road without sacrificing fun.
 
You don’t have to choose between a bucket list trip and a regular annual vacation or a couple of weekend getaways. With careful planning and some easy to follow saving strategies, you can do both (or all three). Take advantage of discount opportunities, make a commitment to save and stick to it and be willing to adjust your plans if the numbers don’t add up. Most of all, have fun and enjoy your vacations both large and small.
