An annuity contract is a written agreement between an insurance company and a customer outlining each party's obligations in an annuity agreement. Such a document will include the specific details of the contract, such as the structure of the annuity (variable or fixed); any penalties for early withdrawal; spousal and beneficiary provisions, such as a survivor clause and rate of spousal coverage; and more.
 
An annuity contract is a contractual obligation between as many as four parties. They are the issuer (usually an insurance company), the owner of the annuity, the annuitant, and the beneficiary. The owner is the person who buys an annuity. An annuitant is an individual whose life is used as the yardstick for determining when benefits payments will start and cease.
 
In most cases, though not all, the owner and annuitant will be the same person. The beneficiary is the individual designated by the annuity owner who will receive any death benefit when the annuitant dies.
 
An annuity contract is beneficial to the individual investor in the sense that it legally binds the insurance company to provide a guaranteed periodic payment to the annuitant once the annuitant reaches retirement and requests commencement of payments. Essentially, it guarantees risk-free retirement income.
 An annuity contract may simply refer to any annuity. 
Annuities can be complex, and annuity contracts may not be very helpful to many investors due to unfamiliar concepts and terminology. Keep in mind the following when shopping for an annuity:
 
Annuity contracts have different withdrawal amount policies—make sure they are flexible. For example, most have a 10% withdrawal amount, but if you want to defer and instead withdraw 20% after two years, make sure that is an option without a penalty (known as cumulative withdrawals).
