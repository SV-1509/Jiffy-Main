The countdown to Thanksgiving begins right after Halloween. While some folks crave turkey, dressing, and pumpkin pie, others salivate thinking about shopping after the big feast. The biggest shopping day of the year, known as "Black Friday," is a time when retailers offer steep price cuts on electronics, apparel, kitchenware, and toys. And even the threat of brawling crowds of shoppers and mile-long lines won’t deter many Americans from their mission to score the best deals.
 
During the 2019 Black Friday weekend (from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday), approximately 189 million Americans shopped either in stores or online, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).﻿﻿
 
The NRF reported in December 2019 that it expected holiday retail sales during November and December to total between $727.9 billion and $730.7 billion.﻿﻿
 
As you’re inundated with an avalanche of Black Friday commercials, catalogs, and coupons, it can be tough to determine which stores will have the competitive offers.
 
Shoppers can take advantage of both brick-and-mortar shops and their online counterparts, and below are four stores known for offering significant deals on Black Friday.
 
Macy's is practically synonymous with Thanksgiving, thanks to its Thanksgiving Parade in New York City, along with its legendary doorbusters. Macy's 80-page 2019 Black Friday circular had 1200-thread-count sheet sets for $29.99, and designer separates and pajama sets for $19.99.﻿﻿
 
With more than 750 stores across over 43 states and Washington, D.C., this retail icon offers a wide assortment of clothing, shoes, accessories, kitchenware, home decor, cosmetics, and jewelry.﻿﻿ Macy’s routinely slashes its prices for Thanksgiving weekend, and the department store also offers significant Black Friday coupons.
 
Macy's Black Friday begins with doorbusters at 5:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Stores close at 2:00 a.m. on Friday and reopen at 6:00 a.m. for Black Friday itself.﻿﻿
 
As you devise your shopping strategy, JCPenney (the branded store name) may not be the first store on your itinerary⁠—but maybe it should be. From clothing and jewelry to home furnishings and cookware, this national retailer serves up some of the best deals and steals on Thanksgiving.
 According to the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Prosper Insights & Analytics, during the holiday shopping season, consumers plan on spending an average of $1,047.83. 
JCPenney tied Kohl's for the top spot on WalletHub’s Best Stores for Black Friday in 2017, with an average discount of 66.3%.﻿﻿ And 2019 was another year of significant savings. JCPenney released a 72-page look book online advertising big savings across all retail categories from toys to electronics.﻿﻿
 
In 2019, the store offered $20 to $30 comforter sets, 50% off Disney toys, and deep discounts on clothing and appliances. JCPenney also offers exclusive coupons for early shoppers on Thursday.﻿﻿
 
Early-bird shoppers (those in line before 2 pm) in 2019 were offered special savings coupons: a $10 off a $10 purchase, $100 off $100, or $500 off $500. JCPenney doors open at 2 p.m. on Thursday and stay open all day on Friday.﻿﻿
 
Whether you’re looking for deals on toys, clothing, electronics, furniture, entertainment, or office supplies, many shoppers believe that you can’t go wrong with Target. WalletHub reported that Target offered an average Black Friday discount of 34.3% in 2019.﻿﻿
 
Target's 2019 Black Friday circular advertised a Samsung 50" Smart UHD TV for $279.00, 50% off many toys and games, and $10 sweaters.﻿﻿ 
 
This one-stop-shopping destination ramps up holiday savings well before Thanksgiving. To sweeten the deal, Target also offers a price match policy in stores and online. Target's Black Friday extravaganza starts at 5:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving, with stores closing at 1:00 a.m. on Friday and reopening at 7:00 a.m.﻿﻿
 
Although sometimes overlooked, this specialty department store offers significant deals during Thanksgiving weekend. In 2018, Kohl’s shoppers enjoyed an average Black Friday discount of 60.8%.﻿﻿
 
The retailer advertised deep discounts on everything from jewelry, apparel, and kitchenware to game consoles and toys in its 2019 Black Friday circular. Plus, the leaflet contained a coupon for 15% off your entire in-store or online purchase, except for some of the higher-end brands.﻿﻿
 
Kohl's opens at 5:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving and remains open until 1:00 a.m. on Black Friday. Online Black Friday doorbusters begin at 12:01 a.m. Central Standard Time on Thanksgiving Day.﻿﻿
 
In the days directly before and after the Thanksgiving holiday, hundreds of retailers advertise rock-bottom prices and out-of-this-world deals. If recent history is any indicator, however, you’ll probably get the biggest bang for your Black Friday buck at these popular four retailers.
