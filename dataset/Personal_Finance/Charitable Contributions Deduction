One of the itemized deductions available for taxpayers who donate to charity. The Charitable Contributions Deduction allows taxpayers to deduct all of their contributions to qualifying charitable contributions of cash and property within certain limitations. ﻿﻿ These deductions must be listed on Schedule A of the 1040.
 
The Charitable Contributions Deduction allows taxpayers who make substantial charitable gifts and take sizeable tax deductions for the year in which their donations are made. The rules for deducting these gifts can be complicated in certain instances. Taxpayers with questions about the deductibility of their gifts should download the instructions for Schedule A off of the IRS website.﻿﻿
 
In order to deduct charitable contributions, the recipient charity must be a qualified organization under section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Some of the acceptable charities include:
 
The IRS imposes caps on the total value of charitable contributions that may be tax deductible in a given year--typically 50 percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. This applies the majority of charities receiving the donations, including all public charities, all private operating foundations, and certain private foundations that distribute the contributions they receive to public charities and private operating foundations within 2-1/2 months after the year of receiving the donations. A 30 percent limit is imposed on contributions made to certain veteran’s organizations, fraternal groups and cemeteries.﻿﻿
