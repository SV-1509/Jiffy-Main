Many kids go from sport to sport, looking for one that fits his or her likes and abilities. You know the drill: soccer one season, baseball the next. Between registration and sport-specific equipment, all this dabbling gets expensive.
 
The costs definitely add up once your child decides to pursue a particular sport to a higher level. You can expect to add higher coaching fees, travel costs for competitions (including gas, hotel and food), event entry fees, membership fees and more specialized equipment. While we want to encourage our children to be physically and mentally active, we don't want to go broke in the process. Here are seven ways to help you pay for your child's athletic pursuits.

Rather than mortgage the house, you can hunt and gather bits of money from several different avenues.
