The Hawaiian Airlines Business Mastercard, with an annual fee of $99, allows small business owners and their employees who prefer to fly with Hawaiian to earn solid rewards. This card comes with few or no travel features but has generous one-time rewards and no foreign transaction fees.
 Earn 60,000 miles after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days, and earn an additional 10,000 miles when a purchase is made on an employee card.

The Hawaiian Airlines Business Mastercard is best suited to businesses whose employees frequently travel to and from Hawaii—or make a number of intra-island flights. Since it offers no benefits, the card makes sense only if your business earns enough in rewards to justify most or all of the $99 annual fee. Achieving that goal would require charging an average of $225 or so in Hawaiian flights to the card every month, or about $340 in gas, dining, and office supplies. Businesses who travel a lot to the Aloha State may, of course, may already be spending that much and more. In fact, if annual credit-card charges routinely run to the mid- to upper- five figures in dollars, the Hawaiian Airlines Business Mastercard might be suitable as your main business credit card.That’s because those spending levels trigger miles bonuses that make the card’s rewards even more solid. The 20,000-miles bonuses at both $50,000 and $100,000 in annual spending essentially add about $250 apiece in annual value to the card. 
 
This card offers up to 70,000 bonus miles, provided you meet two conditions.
 
First, you must spend at least $1,000 in the first 90 days to receive 60,000 bonus miles. To get the remaining 10,000 bonus miles, you must add an employee card to the account and record at least one purchase with that card in the first 90 days.
 
The miles are valued at 1.27 cents each when used for air travel, according to our valuations. That means the 70,000 bonus miles would be worth about $889 in award-flight credits. 
 
There are a number of ways to earn rewards when making purchases with the Hawaiian Airlines Business Mastercard. 
 
First, you earn three miles per dollar on Hawaiian Airlines purchases. Next, you can earn two miles per dollar at gas stations, office supply stores, and restaurants. You can earn one mile per dollar on all other purchases. You can sometimes beat the rates above by shopping at the HawaiianMiles Marketplace online. Some of the partners—which include hotels, gas stations, restaurants and major retailers—offer deals that allow you to bonus miles on your purchases. 
 
Miles are unlimited, so the more you spend, the more you can earn. And spending more with this card each year is a good thing if you want to qualify for the 20,000-mile bonuses that kick in at $50,000 and $100,000 in annual spending.
 
There are numerous ways to redeem miles earned with this card. For instance, you can redeem them for: 
 
Generally, you'll get the most value from your miles when you use them for award travel with Hawaiian Airlines, where we estimate their value at 1.27 cents each. The points required for return awards flights in the main cabin from the U.S. range (according to availability and with discounts) from 35,000 to 170,000 miles from the west coast, or from 53,000 to 220,000 miles from eastern cities.   
 
In addition to flights to and from the U.S, miles can be used for flights between Hawaiian islands and to:
 
Generally, you'll need the least amount of miles if you want island hop from one part of Hawaii to another. For example, you can book a Main Cabin flight between islands for as little as 7,500 miles. 
 
The more far-flung your destination is from Hawaii, the more miles you'll need for an award flight. You'll need at least 40,000 miles for a Main Cabin fare to Japan, Korea, Australia or New Zealand. Study Hawaiian's award chart to see how many miles you'll need to book a flight. 
 
Making the most of the Hawaiian Airlines Business Mastercard begins with ensuring you spend the required $1,000 within your first 90 days, and earn the card’s hefty 60,000-mile one-time offer. In addition, unless you’re a solo entrepreneur, consider adding at least one employee card and have that person use it once, to earn an additional 10,000 bonus miles. After that, this card’s rewards earnings are determined by how much you spend, and on what. It makes sense to charge at least all Hawaiian Air flights to the card, since it’s unlikely any other card will offer better rewards on those purchases. But beyond those, you may want to be more selective in how much you use this card, as these two reward scenarios highlight. (Our calculations do not include the value of the card’s one-time offers.)   
 
Assume that you and one employee each takes two business trips each to Hawaii every year, spending an annual total of $5,000 with Hawaiian Airlines. With 3 miles per dollar spent in rewards, those ticket purchases earn you 15,000 miles. You also spend $10,000 on gas, dining, and office supplies, which yields a further 20,000 miles at the 2-miles-per dollar rate. 
 
Altogether, you'd earn 35,000 miles. At our estimated value of 1.27 cents per mile, those miles would be worth an estimated $445. 
 
This assumes that you and your employees make three times as many trips to Hawaii as our average Aloha-traveling enterprise. That spending, of $15,000 a year on Hawaiian Airlines purchases, would earn 45,000 points (at the 3-miles-per-dollar-spent rate). It further assumes that you use the Hawaiian Airlines Business Mastercard for a host of other business spending. You charge $20,000 a year on gas, office supplies, and dining expenses, which yields another 30,000 rewards miles. You also spend $15,000 annually on miscellaneous business purchases, for an additional 15,000 points. 
 
In total, then, this is the spending/mileage your business would earn:
