Knowing how interest on savings accounts works can help investors earn as much as possible on the money they save. Let's say you have $1,000 in the bank and the account earns 1% interest. In fact, until around 2019, 1% was far more than what most banks were paying in savings accounts due to historically low interest rates. But with interest rates rising, some banks are offering savings accounts that yield over 2%. For this article—which is all about compound interest and how it works—1% is a good round number to illustrate this type of interest's effects.
 
In the simplest of words, $1,000 at 1% interest per year would yield $1,010 at the end of the year. But that is simple interest, paid only on the principal. Money in savings accounts will earn compound interest, where the interest is calculated based on the principal and all accumulated interest.
 Benjamin Franklin provided an example of the power of compounding—dubbed snowballing—where $4,500 left to each of two American cities outperformed the rate of inflation over 200 years. 
So in the case of savings accounts, interest is compounded, either daily, monthly, or quarterly, and you earn interest on the interest earned up to that point. The more frequently interest is added to your balance, the faster your savings will grow. So with daily compounding, every day the amount that earns interest grows by another 1/365th of 1%. At the end of the year, the deposit has grown to $1,010.05.
 
Okay, $0.05 more doesn't sound like much. But at the end of 10 years, your $1,000 would grow to $1,105.17 with compound interest.﻿﻿ Your 1% interest rate, compounded daily for 10 years, has added more than 10% to the value of your investment.
 
Yes, this still might not seem like much, but now consider what would happen if you were able to save $100 a month and add it to that original deposit of $1,000. After one year, you would have earned $16.05 in interest, for a balance of $2,216.05. After 10 years, still adding just $100 a month, you would have earned $725.50, for a total of $13,725.50.
 
Still not a fortune, but it's a reasonable rainy-day fund. And that is the main purpose of a savings account. When money managers talk about "liquid assets," they mean any possession that can be turned into cash on demand. It is, by definition, safe from fluctuations in the stock market and real estate values. In real-people terms, it's the emergency stash.
