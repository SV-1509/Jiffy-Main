Is Social Security safe? There are some folks in Congress predicting its bankruptcy and pushing cuts in benefits or even privatization of the program. Is there any need for such drastic measures? Below, we'll take a look.
 
First, we’ll review the basics of the program, then we’ll survey the latest numbers provided in the 2020 Annual Report from the Board of Trustees that oversees the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) trust funds. Finally, we’ll examine possible fixes that have been proposed to keep Social Security solvent and able to pay benefits for the next 75 years.
 
Notice that insurance is part of the names of both Social Security trust funds. That’s because Social Security was designed during the Great Depression as a safety net to be sure that we never again find seniors living under bridges, as was common then. It was designed as insurance, and Social Security payments are called “benefits.”﻿﻿ 
 
But first, let's explore some terminology. The whole program managed by the Social Security Administration (SSA) is known as Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI). Note that, as the annual report’s name makes clear, there are two funds: one for retirees (the OASI Trust Fund), and one for the disabled (the DI Trust Fund).﻿﻿ The financial status of each is in a very different position, with different possible solutions to fix the financial problems.
 
Social Security benefits are based on a pay-as-you-go system. That means current workers pay Social Security taxes, while current retirees get benefits based on that tax revenue and earned income from the trust fund bonds.﻿﻿ 
 
The concern related to that pay-as-you-go structure is that the huge baby boomer generation (people born between 1946 and 1964) will create a crisis because so many will begin collecting Social Security. By the year 2031, when the youngest boomers reach age 67, there will be 75 million people over the age of 65, nearly double the 39 million who were that age in 2008. This will change the ratio of retirees collecting benefits to workers paying into the system.
 
The beneficiary-to-worker ratio is expected to rise from 35 per 100 in 2014 and reach 45 per 100 in 2030, putting a strain on that pay-as-you-go system.﻿﻿ 
 The year that the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Trust (OASDI) fund will run out of money. 
This baby boomer wave was not unexpected; in fact, it was planned for in 1983, when Alan Greenspan headed the National Commission on Social Security Reform, also known as the Greenspan Commission. At that time the trust funds almost did run out of money.﻿﻿ The commission did an excellent job of finding fixes to deal with the boomer wave.
 
One of the biggest changes was accelerating scheduled increases in Social Security tax rates, in order to build up the trust funds. In 1983, the tax rate was 5.4% for employees and another 5.4% for employers. The commission proposed hiking it to 5.7% beginning in 1984, then 6.06% in 1988, and 6.2% in 1990.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 The year that the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund will run out of funds. 
The Greenspan Commission’s fix worked just as intended, and the nation has billions in the Social Security trust funds. The 2020 annual report on the trust funds showed these basic facts: 
 
Yes, a fix is needed to avoid a reduction in benefits when the trust funds run out of money. Many different fixes have been suggested to restore Social Security’s financial health for the next 75 years. A tax increase is not the only way. It is most likely that some combination of the fixes will be used to minimize the impact on everyone. The sooner Congress acts to fix the system, the less painful the fix will be:
 
Social Security is nowhere near bankruptcy. As Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, put it in her analysis of the 2017 annual report from the Board of Trustees:
 
If there is no fix in the next 20 years, reduced benefits could be still paid with pay-as-you-go tax revenue. However, the sooner Congress does pass a fix and makes Social Security solvent, the better it will be for all of us.
