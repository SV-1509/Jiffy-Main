PenFed Credit Union, one of the biggest credit unions in the United States,﻿﻿ offers a variety of products—including personal loans. While the credit union is well known in the military, anyone can become a member.
 
You may qualify for a PenFed personal loan with a credit score as low as 580. The most creditworthy borrowers may qualify for an interest rate as low as 6.49%﻿﻿ . Our PenFed personal loan review covers everything you need to know. Here’s how to figure out if the lender is a good fit for you.
 Borrow as little as $500 Co-signer allowed Financial hardship protection No prequalification Must belong to PenFed credit union $25,000 loan limit 
PenFed’s personal loan has no origination fee or prepayment penalty.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ However, there are a few other fees to watch for:
 
PenFed personal loan borrowers less than 30 days delinquent can skip one payment at a time with PenFed's self-service courtesy skip payment program. Interest will continue to accrue and extend the life of your loan.﻿﻿
 
PenFed offers one type of unsecured personal loan. You can use the loan proceeds for things such as debt consolidation, home improvements, car repairs, and travel.﻿﻿ You will have to make payments to creditors on your own, though.
 
Depending on the method of payment, approved applicants may receive loan funds as soon as the next business day.
 
There are two ways to apply for a PenFed personal loan. You can complete an application online through its website or apply by phone. Either way, there isn’t an option to prequalify with a soft credit pull. Once you apply, there will be a hard pull on your credit, which will temporarily lower your credit score.
 
The online application is a four-step process:
 
After submitting the application, you will be asked to join PenFed Credit Union. To qualify, you must be at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen or resident alien. You can join PenFed by opening a savings account with a $5 deposit.
 
According to a representative, you may receive immediate approval by phone or online. If PenFed needs to review the application, it may take 24 to 48 hours to get a response. The third option is getting a decline with adverse action, which will include a letter by mail.
 
If PenFed approves your application, you will receive the complete paperwork and check by mail. This can take five to seven business days.
 
If you have a personal loan from another company, you may be able to refinance and get a better rate with PenFed. However, you can’t refinance an existing PenFed personal loan with a new one.
 PenFed may be worth a look if your credit score is fair and you need a small personal loan. Even if you don’t qualify for the lowest interest rate, the highest rate is still competitive and PenFed's fees are reasonable. Also, you can apply with a co-signer if you don’t think you will get approved on your own. It won’t be a good fit if you don't want to join PenFed Credit Union, as you need to be a member to qualify for any of its products. You also can’t prequalify before submitting an application. This may be a problem for borrowers who already have less-than-perfect credit. Plus, if you're lookning to borrow more than $20,000 you'll need to look elsewhere.
