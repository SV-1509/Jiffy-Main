Form 2441, Child and Dependent Care Expenses, is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form used to report child and dependent care expenses on your tax return in order to claim a tax credit for those expenses. If you paid someone, whether it be an individual or a care facility, to look after a child or another qualifying dependent so you could work or look for work, you may be eligible to use it to claim a tax credit.﻿﻿
 
The IRS spells out specific guidelines on who is eligible to claim the child and dependent care tax credit and what the credit is worth. Qualified care expenses, which include household services, were paid if you paid someone to care for a dependent in your home. Care expenses paid to a child or dependent care center also qualify. The following must be true.
 
The credit, which reduces your tax liability, can be worth 20% to 35% of some or all of the dependent care expenses you paid for the year. The credit maxes out at $2,100 for 2020.﻿﻿
 
Form 2441 is used to figure the amount of child and dependent care expenses for which you may able to claim a tax credit. Filling out this form doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be eligible for the credit. Instead, it’s used to help you calculate what the credit may be worth to you if you qualify. You complete this form and attach it to Form 1040 when filing your taxes.
 
Form 2441 is a two-page document that requires you to include specific information about your dependents and child care expenses.
