Choosing the right type of savings account can be confusing. Are you better off with a certificate of deposit (CD)? A traditional savings account? A money market account (MMA)? In some ways, these three types of savings accounts are similar. They're all taxable accounts you can open at a bank or credit union, and are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).﻿﻿﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Each account has pros and cons, and the right choice will be different depending on how much money you have and your personal needs.
 
These simple accounts are one of the most basic ways to bank your money. A savings account is a good choice for a young person’s first bank account, or for anyone who needs easy access to their cash. Most banks don’t require a large deposit to open a savings account. Often $25 is sufficient. You may need to keep a minimum balance in the account to avoid a monthly fee, which can range from $25 to $1,000, depending on the bank and the account.
 
If your savings and checking accounts are with the same bank, you'll likely be able to easily transfer money between the accounts or use your savings account for overdraft protection. A linked savings account makes it especially easy to move money from your savings to your checking account. You won’t be penalized for withdrawals from your savings account, but you won’t earn that much in interest either. One exception is high-yield savings accounts, which offer significantly higher interest rates. These are typically at online-only banks and offer some of the best savings account rates.
 Small initial deposit required to open an account Often, no fees are charged when a minimum balance is maintained Easy to transfer money to a linked checking account No penalties or limitations for withdrawals FDIC or NCUA protected Very low interest rates (often below the inflation rate) 
Another type of savings account, money market accounts (MMAs) are similar to traditional savings accounts but often require that you have more money to save. Typically, you’ll need a larger deposit to open the account—$1,000 is common—and will need to maintain a higher balance to avoid fees (this can be as high as $5,000). However, you’ll be rewarded with a higher interest rate. Unlike traditional savings accounts, which pay a flat annual interest rate, many MMAs have a tiered interest rate, with higher rates for larger balances. This makes them desirable for those who are able to maintain a high daily balance in the account. Another perk offered by many MMAs is the ability to write checks from the account, though this is limited to six times each month.﻿﻿
 Money market accounts are not the same as money market mutual funds, which are a type of investment vehicle. Higher interest rates than a traditional savings account Often have the ability to write checks Withdrawals without penalty FDIC or NCUA protected Higher balance needed to avoid monthly fees Limitation on the number of monthly withdrawals Lower interest rates if balance drops out of higher tiers 
When you purchase a certificate of deposit (CD) from a bank, you are allowing the bank to use your money for a fixed period of time, which means you will face a steep fine for early withdrawals. However, the interest rates are higher for CDs than for traditional savings accounts or MMAs, making them desirable for those who can make large deposits without needing access to the money during the CD’s term. Terms can be as short as a month, or as long as ten years. You can find CDs with no minimum, but typically the required initial deposit is larger, often $1,000 or more.
 
Like with MMAs, higher balances on CDs tend to offer higher rates. CDs generally have fixed interest rates, but some banks offer variable-rate CDs as well. It's important to keep in mind that the particular bank you select and the length of your term can have a large impact on your interest rate. Shop around to find the top CD rates as they change frequently.
