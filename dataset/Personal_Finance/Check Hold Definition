A check hold denotes the maximum number of days that a bank can legally hold the money from a deposited check. After the check hold period has expired, the bank must credit the funds to the account of the party making the deposit.
 
The check holding period is generally equal to the number of days it takes for the check to go through the bank's clearing cycle.
 
The Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987 (EFAA) mandated that local checks may be held for no more than two business days. After 2010, all checks in the United States were considered local. The two-day hold has been extended to five days as a reasonable limit for holding local checks. The Federal Reserve requires that a bank hold most checks before crediting the customer’s account for no longer than a “reasonable period of time,” which is regarded as two business days for a same-bank check and up to six business days for one drawn on a different bank. Financial institutions may hold on-us items for one business day following the deposit. Many use the term EFAA Regulation interchangeably with (Reg) CC.
 
Banks may currently decide to place six types of holds on checks:
 
Banks may not hold cash or electronic payments, direct deposit, money orders, Treasury checks; Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan checks, cashier’s, certified, or teller’s checks, and state or local government checks, along with the first $5,000 of traditional checks that are not in question (next-day items). It’s also imperative that commercial banks disclose their hold policies to all account holders. If a customer requests it, the bank must provide its policy in written form.
