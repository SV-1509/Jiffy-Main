The most expensive ZIP codes in the country are in California and New York, according to America’s most expensive ZIP codes rankings by PropertyShark. To find the priciest enclaves, PropertyShark analyzed all real estate transactions—condominiums, single- and two-family homes, as well as coops—that were completed in 2018, excluding package deals.
 
Not surprisingly, New York City and San Francisco were the two cities with the most ZIP codes in the ranking. Just across the Long Island Sound, Connecticut had its share of pricey neighborhoods, with four ZIP codes making the top 100 list—the most expensive being Riverside (06878). The city snagged the 70th spot. Connecticut's Old Greenwich (06870) and Greenwich (06830) also made the site's top 100.﻿﻿

Connecticut’s most expensive ZIP codes are all part of Fairfield County on the Gold Coast, and are an easy commute to the New York City area. Many people who work in New York City live in Connecticut, where they’ll get a lot more house for their money. For $1.42 million in Riverside, you can get into a home that is a few thousand square feet with several bedrooms on a couple of acres.﻿﻿ At that price in Manhattan, you’ll probably be looking at a modest two-bedroom condo.﻿﻿ And Connecticut offers plenty of green space to enjoy the outdoors and get away from the city.
