The registered retirement savings plan deduction limit is the maximum sum that Canada allows its taxpayers to deduct from their income when calculating tax liability. The registered retirement savings plan deduction limit, or RRSP deduction limit, is set by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). The sum of contributions made to a taxpayer's personal RRSP and his or her spouse's or common-law partner's RRSP must be lower than the RRSP deduction limit or withholding taxes will be imposed on the coverage.
 
In order to arrive at a taxpayer's contribution limit, the CRA calculates the taxpayer's maximum contribution earned for the year, according to his or her annual income. The agency then deducts transfers of certain qualifying income made to the taxpayer's RRSP throughout the year.
 
Finally, the CRA calculates for pension adjustments using previous service pension adjustments, then adds back pension adjustment reversals and carries forward any unused RRSP deductions that were not used in previous years. Deduction limits are shown on each Canadian taxpayer's personal Notice of Assessment.
 
Canadian taxpayers can find their registered retirement savings plan (RRSP)/pooled registered savings plan (PRPP) deduction limit (often called their "contribution room") in the following ways:
 
Deductions may be entered on line 208 of the income tax and benefit return under the following guidelines provided by the CRA.
 
Interest on money borrowed to contribute to an RRSP may not be deducted. There may be changes in RRSP deduction limits and what is deductible in any given year, so taxpayers should check the CRA periodically. For example, contributions to a spouse's or common-law partner's RRSP or SPP have specific deductibility rules, as do contributions made to a Home Buyer's Plan (HBP) and a Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP). In most cases, the CRA will inform a taxpayer of any changed in their RRSP deduction limit.
