A document published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) providing information about the tax credit available to the elderly or the disabled. Qualifying individuals are U.S. citizens or resident aliens over the age of 65 or retired on permanent and total disability. Nonresident aliens may be eligible for the credit if they are married to a citizen or resident alien. Married couples typically have to file a joint tax return in order to qualify.﻿﻿
 
Depending on a taxpayer's filing status, the amount of adjusted gross income (AGI) or nontaxable Social Security and pension can prevent the credit from being given. An AGI or nontaxable pension or Social Security income of above-specified income limits disqualifies a taxpayer.﻿﻿
