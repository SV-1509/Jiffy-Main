Founded in 2007, LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending marketplace offering personal loans for borrowers. The company offers loans as low as $1,000 with no prepayment penalties. Our LendingClub personal loan review will cover relevant information for you to assess whether it’s the right fit. The details outlined here include terms, rates, fees, and credit score requirements. 
 
LendingClub offers fixed-rate loans ranging from 10.68% to 35.89% APR, which includes an origination fee of 2% to 6%.﻿﻿ LendingClub offers personal loans from $1,000 to $40,000, however, minimum loan amounts may vary depending on where you live. Your repayment term may be either 36 or 60 months.﻿﻿ Although LendingClub doesn’t explicitly state a minimum required credit score, we suggest a score of at least 600. LendingClub also considers factors like your credit history and proof of on-time payments.﻿﻿
 Joint applications offered Low loan amounts for borrowers who don’t need a large sum No prepayment penalties Personal loans not available nationwide Origination fees charged Longer funding times compared with other lenders 
All LendingClub members have a 15-day grace period to make payments with no penalty. Borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 can apply for a two-month payment deferral plan referred to as Skip-a-Pay.
 
As of April 30, 2020, approximately 11% of LendingClub’s outstanding personal loans have been enrolled in Skip-a-Pay and the company is rolling out additional graduation and hardship programs for customers.﻿﻿
 
New loans are still being made but weighted towards existing members with positive payment histories.
 
Members can apply for Skip-a-Pay by phone at 877-759-2200 or access the application online in the Member Center by clicking "Learn More" on the “We’re here to help!” message. All applicants should allow seven to 10 days for an email confirming their approval.﻿﻿
 
Personal loans from LendingClub can be used for almost any purpose, including major expenses such as a wedding, medical bills, or home repairs, debt consolidation, and balance transfers.
 
However, you’re restricted from using loan proceeds for the following:
 
Although LendingClub doesn’t charge a prepayment penalty, there is an origination fee that’s 2% to 6% of your loan amount. Also, if you’re late on your monthly payment for more than 15 days, LendingClub will charge you $15 or 5% of the unpaid balance, whichever amount is greater. 
 
Most LendingClub borrowers will receive their loan proceeds within four days, though it can vary depending on factors such as how fast you can submit any additional supporting documentation.﻿﻿
 
LendingClub offers applicants the ability to check their rate without affecting their credit score.﻿﻿ A hard credit inquiry will take place once applicants decide to move forward with the application process, which could affect your score. 
 
LendingClub does offer joint applications. Simply indicate that you want to check your rate as two borrowers and submit any necessary documentation from the both of you when the lender reviews your application.
 
Head to LendingClub’s website to get a rate quote through a soft credit inquiry. Here’s what the application process may look like:
 
Once your loan is approved, sign your loan agreement, and LendingClub will send you your funds in as little as four days.
 
LendingClub won’t let you refinance your personal loan. However, you can take out an additional personal loan, as long as both loans combined aren’t more than $50,000. To qualify, you’ll need to have made on-time payments for three consecutive months, among other financially related factors.
 If you have a good to excellent credit score, you may qualify for more competitive personal loans, without an origination fee, elsewhere. But if your credit score is less-than-perfect, you want a co-borrower, and don't need the money immediately, LendingClub may be worth a look. Taking out a personal loan might be a smart idea if you need access to cash to fund a large purchase or to consolidate high-interest debt. Shop around and compare various loan offers to find the one that offers you the best rates and terms. When doing so, remember that checking your rate with LendingClub won’t affect your credit score.
