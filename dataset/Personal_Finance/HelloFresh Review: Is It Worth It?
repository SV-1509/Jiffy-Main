HelloFresh is a meal subscription service that delivers everything you need to cook wholesome, healthy meals for your family. As a HelloFresh subscriber, you don't have to work so hard planning a weekly dinner menu in advance and dragging all the ingredients home from the grocery store. The company handles everything but the cooking, providing you with easy-to-follow recipes and carefully portioned, fresh ingredients delivered in an insulated recyclable shipping box once per week.﻿﻿﻿﻿
 
With both meat and vegetarian dining options available, just about everyone should be pleased with the ever-changing recipes and varied flavors HelloFresh provides. While the service may cost more per person than similar meals sourced from a local grocery store, if you're looking to take some of the hassle out of home cooking, HelloFresh is definitely worth trying.
 
HelloFresh offers six subscription plans: Meat & Veggies, Veggie, Family Friendly, Low Calorie, Quick & Easy, and Pescatarian.﻿﻿ Subscribers can select between two and six meals per week for either two or four people, and they have the option of pre-selecting which meals they will receive.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 
Menus are published weekly and can be previewed online.﻿﻿ Prices are identical across all its meal plans. As of February 2020, prices are either $7.49, $8.99 and $10.99 per serving, depending on how much you order. Delivery is $6.99.﻿﻿
 
For example, a subscriber ordering two meals per week for two people would pay $10.99 per serving, or $50.95 total including the cost of delivery. If the subscriber ordered three meals per week, the price is $8.99 per serving, or $60.93 total including delivery. The chart below explains the pricing structure in further detail.
 
HelloFresh does not offer gluten-free, dairy-free or nut-free options. Some, but not all, of its ingredients are organic. Subscribers can find nutrition information by logging into their accounts.﻿﻿
 
HelloFresh meals are easy to cook, with suggested cooking times between 30 and 40 minutes in most cases.﻿﻿ All required ingredients are included in your weekly meal shipment except for salt, pepper, sugar, butter, and cooking oil, so make sure you have those items on hand.﻿﻿ All fresh meat and fish ships in vacuum-sealed containers﻿﻿, while fresh produce and other ingredients ship in color-coded bags for easy sorting.
 
HelloFresh insulated boxes ship with ice packs to ensure ingredients stay fresh en route to your refrigerator.﻿﻿ The company designs recipes around ingredients that can maintain prime condition for a week or more after delivery; however, HelloFresh suggests preparing certain recipes, such as those using fresh fish, early in the week to maximize freshness.
 
HelloFresh is not the only ready-to-cook meal service in town. In fact, it has some strong competition from Blue Apron. Both services utilize a similar meal delivery model, providing fresh, raw ingredients and easy recipes for up to a week's worth of dinners. HelloFresh and Blue Apron are very close in price.﻿﻿ In addition, they both offer vegetarian options designed just for vegetarian subscribers. Like HelloFresh, Blue Apron publishes its weekly menus for subscribers to preview online.﻿﻿

The United States is its largest market, with 1.48 million active customers. In the first nine months of 2019, HelloFresh reported 1.3 billion euros in sales.﻿﻿
