Form 1095-C: Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form reporting information about an employee's health coverage offered by an Applicable Large Employer (ALE). ALEs typically have 50 or more full-time employees.﻿﻿
 
Information from this form also helps determine a taxpayer's eligibility for credits, such as the premium tax credit.﻿﻿
 An individual enrolled in a marketplace health care plan will receive Form 1095-A: Health Insurance Marketplace Statement. 
This form is provided by Applicable Large Employers to full-time employees who have been working for one or more months of the calendar year. ALE members must report that information for all 12 months or the entire calendar year for each employee.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 
Form 1095-C is a reference document not completed by the taxpayer. It is not filed with a tax return. Instead, it should be kept with the taxpayer's records.﻿﻿
 
If Parts I and II are the only sections filled, the employee may also receive a form 1095-B: Health Coverage, which provides proof of coverage from the insurer chosen by the employer. ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 
Form 1095-B is used by employers to report information to the IRS and to taxpayers about individuals covered by minimum essential coverage and who are not liable for the individual shared responsibility payment.﻿﻿
