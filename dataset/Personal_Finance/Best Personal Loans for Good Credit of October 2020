If you're a would-be borrower who has good credit—you're in luck. Not only will you have access to more lenders, but you could find that you’ll qualify for more favorable interest rates and better terms on your loans, and perhaps even be able to borrow a higher amount.
 
If your credit score is 670 or above—like 67% of all Americans—congrats: You may qualify for the creamiest loans. But if you want the crème de la crème, you'll need to shop around, and that's where we come in. We've researched numerous personal loan options, comparing—as you should—factors such as the annual percentage rate (APR), origination fees, and how you can use your loan. We’ve also examined features such as qualification requirements, fees, interest rates, and loan limits.
 
SoFi (short for Social Finance) is an online lender and wealth management company. Though it's best known for student loans—its original core business, which began in 2011—we've ranked it the best overall in personal loans because it offers some of the lowest interest rates around, some of the highest loan amounts, and a whole host of benefits for members (as it quaintly calls customers) such as unemployment protection.
 High loan limit (up to $100,000) No fees for loan origination or early payoff, or even for late payments Member benefits such as exclusive in-person events, personalized career advice, and financial planning from credentialed advisors Small fry needn't apply: $5,000 minimum loan, higher than other lenders' Higher-income borrowers or those with a high-end credit score have a better chance of qualifying Wait times: Release of funds after loan approval can take several days

It’s safe to assume that the higher your credit score, the more doors are open for you. That means more lenders are willing to offer you personal loans at the lowest rates and best terms. While 670 is the minimum "good" FICO credit score, lenders tend to give preference to those with at least a 690 score, and more so if you have an excellent credit score closer to the 800 range. 
 
The good news is that there are plenty of lenders that offer personal loans for borrowers with good credit. Options include banks, credit unions, brick and mortar institutions, and online lenders. Don't assume any one type is the best: Though online lenders often have lower nominal rates, for example, their fees might make their effective rates less competitive.
 
When comparing personal loan options, it’s important to understand all the terms and conditions in order to find the one that will both cost you the least and that fits your needs.
