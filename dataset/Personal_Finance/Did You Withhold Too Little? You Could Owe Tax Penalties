The chance you are under-withholding taxes may be higher than you think. A 2018 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggests that a fifth of taxpayers, more than 30 million people, may owe taxes due to underwithholding.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 
If you're one of those people, to avoid a penalty with an estimated tax payment, take one of the appropriate actions outlined below.
 
Your employer is required to withhold taxes on your pay based on withholding tables provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), but you can reduce the amount withheld by claiming withholding allowances.﻿﻿ Historically, allowances have been based on personal exemptions, which no longer exist due to changes brought on by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).﻿﻿
 
According to the GAO, the U.S. Treasury Department chose the same withholding allowance value ($4,150 for 2018) that would have existed under old tax law. This resulted in 30 million people underwithholding in 2018, vs. 27 million who would have underwithheld under previous tax law.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 
The U.S. tax system operates on a "pay-as-you-go" (sometimes called "pay as you earn") basis, meaning you are required to withhold or pay estimated taxes during the tax year.﻿﻿ The elimination of the personal exemption, changes to withholding tables brought on by the TCJA, and the fact that taxpayers were encouraged, but not required, to file an updated W-4 Form may have resulted in under-withholding of taxes for millions of taxpayers.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 
According to the GAO, a married taxpayer with two children who earns $180,000 annually, including $20,000 from nonwage income—and who itemizes deductions—is a likely candidate for underwithholding.﻿﻿ You may also find yourself underwithholding in the following circumstances:
 
If any of these apply to you—and you also failed to update your withholding—the risk of underwithholding is even greater.
 
Normally, an underpayment penalty may apply if the amount withheld (or paid through estimated taxes) is not equal to the smaller of 90% of the taxes you owe for the current year or 100% of the taxes you owed for the previous year.﻿﻿ If a penalty applies, it is typically 0.5% of the amount owed for each month that amount was unpaid.﻿﻿
 
The penalty may also be waived under these circumstances.
 
Even if you don’t qualify for a waiver, you may qualify for a reduced penalty in certain circumstances, including a change in marital status or substantial income realized late in the year.﻿﻿
 
Determine whether you underwithheld taxes. The 2019 version of Form 1040 and instructions are on the IRS website along with many supplemental forms and schedules with more being added each day.﻿﻿
 
If you underwithheld taxes last year you must file Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trusts with this year's income tax return no later than April 15.﻿﻿
 
Complete Part I of Form 2210 and the included worksheet and instructions to determine whether a waiver applies in your case.﻿﻿
 
If a waiver does not apply, you will likely owe a penalty. In some cases, the IRS will figure the penalty for you. In other cases, you must use Form 2210 to figure the penalty yourself. See Form 2210, instructions and worksheet for more information.﻿﻿
 
Check your eligibility for the wavier as well as other waivers for which you might qualify.
 
If you underwithheld last year, whether you qualify for a waiver or not, check your withholding to avoid this problem in the future. Use the updated online IRS Withholding Calculator to help you adjust withholding amounts.﻿﻿
