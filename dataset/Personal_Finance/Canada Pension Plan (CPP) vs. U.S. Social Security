The Canada Pension Plan and the U.S. Social Security system are publicly-provided mandatory old-age pension systems. They both provide retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. But the amount you pay in and the benefits you receive differ between the two.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is one of three levels of the Canadian retirement income system.﻿﻿ It was established in 1966 to provide retirement, survivor, and disability benefits.﻿﻿ Almost everyone who works in Canada outside Quebec contributes to the CPP. A separate Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) provides similar benefits to its residents.﻿﻿
 
In general, you must contribute to the CPP (or the QPP if you work in Quebec) if:
 
If you have an employer, you pay half of the required contribution, and your employer pays the rest. If you're self-employed, you pay the whole contribution. You make contributions based on your earnings. For 2020, the contribution rate is 10.5% of the amount you earn between CA$3,500 and CA$58,700.﻿﻿
 
With this cap in place, the maximum contribution for employers and employees is CA$2,898 (US$2,186). If you're self-employed, it's CA$5,796 (US$4,372).﻿﻿
 
The contributions go into a fund managed by the CPP Investment Board, which invests the assets "to maximize returns without undue risk of loss."﻿﻿
 
Similar to the U.S. Social Security system, the Canada Pension Plan provides several types of benefits:
 
Your CPP benefits are based on how much you've contributed and how long you've been making contributions when you become eligible to collect benefits. For 2020, the maximum monthly retirement benefit is CA$1,175 (US$887); the average amount for new beneficiaries in October 2019 was CA$672 (US$508).﻿﻿
 
Social Security is a federal benefits program in the U.S. that was founded in 1935.﻿﻿ Employees and employers each pay 6.2% in taxes on the first $142,800 of income each year (up from $137,700 in 2019). If you're self-employed, you pay the full 12.4%. For 2020, the maximum contribution for employers and employees each is $8,853.60. If you're self-employed, it's $17,707.20 (12.4% of $142,800)﻿﻿﻿.
 
Most people must pay into Social Security, regardless of age. However, exemptions may be available to certain groups of taxpayers, including:
 
Social Security taxes go into the Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund. Although legally distinct, they're collectively known as "the Social Security trust fund."﻿﻿
 
All Social Security payroll taxes are put into the trust funds, and all of Social Security's benefits and administrative costs are paid out of them. The trust funds are invested entirely in U.S. Treasury securities.﻿﻿
 
Like the CPP, the Social Security system provides several types of benefits:
 
To qualify for Social Security benefits, you must have 40 "work credits," which comes out to about 10 years of work.﻿﻿ Your benefits are based on your highest-earning 35 years of work.﻿﻿ For 2021, the maximum monthly retirement benefit is:
 
Budget shortfalls have often threatened the solvency of Social Security. According to the 2019 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Funds, "OASDI cost is projected to exceed total income starting in 2020, and the dollar level of the hypothetical combined trust fund reserves declines until reserves become depleted in 2035."﻿﻿
 
Starting in 2020, Social Security's total cost will exceed its total income. But the trust funds' reserves will supplement the program's income so that Social Security can keep paying full benefits until 2035.﻿﻿ In theory, this gives policymakers time to develop a financing plan.
 
The Canada Pension Plan does not currently face a similar issue.﻿﻿
