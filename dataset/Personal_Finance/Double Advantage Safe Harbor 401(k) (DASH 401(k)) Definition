DASH 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that combines the benefits of a 401(k) with a profit-sharing plan. The Double Advantage Safe Harbor 401(k) (DASH 401(k)) maximizes tax efficiency by stacking several tax code provisions.
 
There are three steps to creating a DASH 401(k):
 
The DASH 401(k) retirement plan is commonly used by employers who want to maximize contributions to a select group, such as owners and executives. In exchange for mandatory vested employer contributions, administration fees are generally lower than with those with a standard 401(k) plan, and contribution limits are much higher.
 
Because the DASH 401(k) plan combines an age-based plan with a Safe Harbor plan, the DASH 401(k) is ideal for business owners and management that are older than their employees. It is also important to note that the employer is making a 3% contribution with immediate vesting commitment to all eligible employees. For this reason, the DASH 401(k) plan is not for all employers.
