You can request a cosigner release after 12 months of consecutive, on-time monthly payments. 
 
PenFed does not have a clear forbearance or discharge policy. However, it does encourage borrowers to contact customer service to discuss options if they are facing financial hardship or another emergency. 
 
According to PenFed, it can take up to 14 days for your old loan servicer to receive the loan payoff funds and apply the money to your previous student loans. If your account isn’t cleared after 14 days, contact PenFed for a status update. 
 
PenFed is both the lender and loan servicer for its refinanced student loans. PenFed has a 2.5 out of 5 TrustScore on Trustpilot from a handful of customer reviews.﻿﻿

You’ll need to have the following information handy to apply for a loan from PenFed: 
 
As student loan refinancers go, PenFed Credit Union has a lot to offer. Its requirements, policies, and terms are clear and openly stated. Not only are its interest rates competitively low, but their range is also impressively short: just about two percentage points between the lowest and the highest APR (none of those 12-point ranges that tease you with a low rate but end up giving you a double-digit one).
 
Then there are its unique features, like the spousal loan refinancing, which lets a couple combine all of their debt into one big loan. And other generous features, like letting parents transfer the loans they've taken out for their kid into the child’s name.
 
In return for its largesse, PenFed does set some limits regarding loan minimums and maximums, graduation status, and income and cosigner requirements. However, cosigners can be freed from their obligation in as little as 12 months, which is highly generous. The lack of an official forbearance or loan discharge policy gives pause, especially given the credit union's transparency, but there's no reason to doubt it would be willing to work with members in distress.
 
The larger question is the idea of refinancing in general. While refinancing your student loans can help you save money and pay off your debt sooner, there are some drawbacks to consider, especially if you have federal student loans. If you do decide to refinance, strong as PenFed Credit Union is, it’s still wise to shop around and compare rates and terms from other lenders.
