Homeowners who need to request a repair using their plan from Home Warranty Inc. can do so 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Once a repair request is submitted, Home Warranty Inc. allows homeowners to choose a local contractor who they’d like to make the repair. If the contractor isn’t already approved to do work for Home Warranty Inc., they must do so before work can begin. This can lead to longer repair times.
 
For homeowners who want to expedite repairs, Home Warranty Inc. also offers a cash-out option for repairs. This allows homeowners to forgo repair of their covered appliance or system and instead take the approved repair cost and use it to pay for a replacement.
 
Home Warranty Inc. customers who need to file a repair request can do so online or by calling 877-977-4949. The company boasts 24/7 live claim support, though customers are more likely to get a quick answer if they call during core business hours (Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time). Home Warranty doesn’t advertise whether emergency repairs are available. However, homeowners who need expedited service are free to schedule their own work but this may not be covered unless it’s performed according to the terms of your plan. The bottom line is to get approval first to ensure you the repair costs are covered.
