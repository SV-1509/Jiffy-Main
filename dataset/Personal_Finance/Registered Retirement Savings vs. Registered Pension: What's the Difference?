Registered retirement savings plans (RRSP) and registered pension plans (RPP) are both retirement savings plans that are registered with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). RRSPs are individual retirement plans, while RPPs are plans established by companies to provide pensions to their employees.﻿﻿﻿﻿ The two plans are comparable to defined-contribution savings plans and defined-benefit pension plans in the United States.
 
A registered retirement savings plan is a retirement savings and investment account for employees and self-employed people in Canada. Contributions are made before taxes, but distributions are taxed at the marginal rate. If someone is taxed at a rate of 30% and he or she contributes $1,000 to an RRSP, the entire sum is applied to the account. In contrast, if the individual took those funds in wages, he or she would pay $300 in income taxes.﻿﻿
 
Individuals are allowed to contribute up to 18% of their earned income annually to their RRSP, up to an annually adjusted cap ($27,830 for the 2020 tax year).﻿﻿
 
You can find your maximum contribution limit on your latest notice of assessment online A of the RRSP Deduction Limit Statement. However, if your taxable income has changed from the previous tax year, your contribution limit has also changed.
 If you contribute more than the annual allowed maximum amount, the extra contribution is considered excess. Excess contributions may be taxed at a rate of 1% per month. 
If you have not made maximum contributions in previous years, however, you may add the value of contributions that were allowed but not made to your current year's allowance. As a result, your maximum contribution limit may be higher than $27,830.﻿﻿
 
Contributions to both RRSPs and registered pension plans are not taxed for Canadian residents (those living abroad may face local taxes). Individuals and their employers may both contribute to RPPs, and neither's contributions are taxed.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
 
Money earned within both RRSPs and RPPs is not subject to income or capital gains taxes.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ However, withdrawals from both plans are taxed as income.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
 
Maximum contributions on RPPs vary based on which type of RPP is being used. There are two types of RPPs: defined benefit RPPs and money purchase RPPs.﻿﻿ In defined benefit plans, the pension amount is known and does not change, but the contribution amount varies. These plans do not have a yearly maximum contribution limit.﻿﻿
 
Money purchase or defined contribution plans do not have a set or predictable pension amount, but employees know how much they are expected to contribute. Maximum annual contributions to money purchase RPPs are the same as they are for RRSPs.﻿﻿
