A Christmas club, also called a holiday club account, is a type of savings account in which people make routine deposits throughout the year. The accumulated savings are then withdrawn before the holiday season to provide funds for Christmas shopping and other holiday expenses, like travel.
 
Participants can choose to have the deposited funds deducted from their paychecks automatically. If money is withdrawn from the Christmas club savings account early, fees and penalties may apply.
 
The point of a Christmas club account is to automate savings throughout the year in advance of the holiday season. In many cases, the money is transferred into a customer's other account, such as a checking or savings account, on Nov. 1 of each year. (Guess how much the average American Christmas costs?)
 
These accounts help participants avoid the financial stress associated with holiday shopping and other related expenses like travel. Saving this money throughout the year can keep people out of going into credit card debt to pay for gifts. It can also help enforce a holiday budget.
