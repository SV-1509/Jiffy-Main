LendingPoint offers an easy, online application process. You can prequalify for personal loan offers by submitting your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and annual income.﻿﻿
 
The lender provides offers with a soft pull, which won’t hurt your credit score. After picking one of LendingPoint’s personal loan offers, a hard pull on your credit will be applied which will temporarily lower your score.

If you need assistance during any part of the application process, you can contact the customer support team by phone at 888-969-0959 or email the company at info@lendingpoint.com.﻿﻿
 
If you’re looking for a better interest rate, you will have the opportunity to refinance with a new LendingPoint personal loan after seven to nine on-time payments, according to a representative.
 LendingPoint may be a good option if you have fair credit and an income of at least $35,000 per year. The easy application process and quick funding are competitive among other lenders that cater to fair credit borrowers. If you make on-time payments, the company reports to credit bureaus Experian and TransUnion which may improve your credit score over time.   You may find better interest rates elsewhere, though. If you’re itching to pay off high-interest credit card debt, LendingPoint’s highest APRs may be more than you’re already paying. Before applying for any personal loan, it’s always a smart idea to shop around and see what options may be available.
