 Extensive network of ATMs and physical locations Different types of CDs Wide selection of deposit accounts and financial products Primarily on the West Coast Interest rates not competitive Minimum balance requirements to avoid monthly fees 
U.S. Bank should appeal to most customers who want a reputable, long-standing bank with a full range of deposit accounts and financial services. It might be a particularly good fit if you:
 
As U.S. Bank is one of the largest banks in the nation, you can expect an extensive range of deposit accounts, financial products, and services. What’s more, it offers accounts and products for businesses and also wealth management services. Its personal accounts and services include:
 
U.S. Bank offers a total of five savings accounts. Here are the particulars of each.﻿﻿
 
Designed for those with low balances and who might be opening their first savings account, Standard Savings features a low $4 monthly maintenance fee. To get the fee waived, you’ll need to maintain one of these two requirements:
 
However, don’t expect to earn a lot in interest by parking your money in U.S. Bank’s savings account. The annual percentage yield (APY) is a measly 0.1%, no matter your balance.
 
If you have a Gold Checking account, you’re eligible to open a Platinum Select Money Market Account. You’ll need at least $25 to open an account, and there’s no monthly account fee. While the interest rates vary depending on where you live, currently the rates aren’t faring much higher than the standard savings.
 
Just as the Platinum Select Money Market Savings is linked to the Gold Checking account, the Package Money Market Savings is linked to U.S. Bank’s Gold Checking package. The minimum required deposit and monthly account fee are on par with the Platinum Select Money Market Savings. You’ll need at least $25 to open an account, and you won’t have to worry about maintaining an average balance to drop the monthly fee. There’s no monthly account fee. The savings rates are as follows:
 
The Elite Money Market Savings account requires a minimum of $100 to open, and to waive the $10 monthly maintenance fee, you’ll need to keep a $10,000 minimum daily balance. The interest rates for the Elite Money Market Savings are:
 
 Geared for those with an individual retirement account (IRA) with the bank, the Retirement Money Market Savings account has no monthly maintenance fee. To open an account, there’s a minimum of $100 to open or a $25 automatic deposit. While it’s advertised as a way to diversify your U.S. Bank investment portfolio, it’s not entirely apparent how it stands out against other saving or investing for retirement vehicles.
 
U.S. Bank also offers five checking accounts. Here is what you need to know about them.﻿﻿
 
U.S. Bank’s Easy Checking Account is a standard checking account. If you’re thinking of applying with a loan through U.S. Bank, with a checking account you’ll be privy to its preferred rates on auto loans, personal loans, and home equity lines. There’s a monthly maintenance fee of $6.95, which can be dropped if you meet one of the following three criteria:
 
There’s a $2.50 ATM fee and a $2 paper statement fee, unless you’re enrolled in eStatements or are 65 and up. 
 
This is U.S. Bank’s version of a prepaid debit card. The Safe Debit Account offers more features than typically come with a standard prepaid debit card. For instance, mobile and online banking, as well as the ability to do a mobile check deposit. 
 
You’ll need $25 to open an account, and there’s a $4.95 monthly maintenance fee that can’t be waived. There are limitations. For instance, you might be able to link it to a checking account, and you can’t opt into overdraft. 
 
As U.S. Bank has quite an extensive network of ATMs in its MoneyPass network—more than 32,000—you won’t be hit with a surcharge.﻿﻿ However, for ATM withdrawals outside of this network, there’s a $2.50 fee.
 
U.S. Bank also offers a free credit score. Through TransUnion CreditView, you can see your current score and how it might change if you take different actions, as well as have access to different resources.﻿﻿
 
This is one of U.S. Bank’s premier checking accounts. The Gold Checking Package is worth considering, especially if you plan on also opening a U.S. Bank loan or credit card in the near future. If your checking is linked to another U.S. Bank deposit account, the overdraft protection fee will be dropped. You’ll be reimbursed for the surcharges on your first two non-ATM fees.
 
You’re entitled to up to 100 free trades per calendar year with a self-directed brokerage account through its affiliate, US Bancorp Investments.﻿﻿ And if you’d like to make it a family affair, Gold Checking allows you to sign up to two family members for Easy Checking without the monthly maintenance fee. You’ll just need to be the co-owner of the accounts.
 
U.S. Bank also will reward you if you have a strong credit score. For instance, your monthly maintenance fee will get dropped, and you’ll get express delivery for replacement cards. The monthly maintenance fee is $14.95 and can be waived if you have a loan or credit card. 
 
The Platinum Checking Package is U.S. Bank’s premier checking account. It essentially comes with all the perks of Gold Checking, plus a few other benefits.For instance, you won’t have to pay a fee on the home equity line of credit. And if you open a credit card, there’s a signup bonus with certain cards.
 
This is the only checking account that offers interest rates.﻿﻿ They are:
 
U.S. Bank’s Student Checking comes with all the usual features of a checking account. There’s no monthly maintenance fee, and your first order of checks is free. Another nice perk is that the surcharges on the first four non-network ATM withdrawals within a statement period are covered. Once you hit four withdrawals, however, the fees kick in.
 In 2019 U.S. Bank settled a $2.67 million class action lawsuit. The allegations were that U.S. Bank had made unwanted calls and texts to consumers about its mortgages and home equity loans. 
If you’re able to squirrel away a set amount of funds and leave them untouched for a set amount of time, a CD might be a good option. The interest rates are typically higher than in a savings or money market account. The downside is that if you need to pull money out before the maturity date, you’ll be pegged with an early withdrawal penalty. U.S. Bank offers four types of CDs.﻿﻿
 
If you have at least $500 to put into a U.S. Bank CD, here are the APYs:
 
The early withdrawal penalties are the same for all CDs. 
 
If the account has a term of six months or less, you’ll be dinged with a $25 early withdrawal fee and either 1% of the amount you take out or all the interest that would’ve been earned for the entire term, whichever is greater.
 
If the account has a term that’s greater than six months through 12 months, it’s $25 plus either one-half of all the interest that would’ve been earned for the entire term or 1% of the amount withdrawn, whichever is greater.
 
And for accounts with a term that’s greater than one year? You’ll need to pony up $25 plus whichever is greater: one-half of the interest that would’ve been earned for the entire term or 3% of the amount you took out.
 
If you have at least $1,000 to park into a CD Special, you can snag the following promotional APYs:
 
A 28-month CD, the Step Up CD locks you into a rate when you open. You can deposit anywhere from $1,000 to $249,000. Then every seven months you get an APY bump, as follows: 
 
Are you able to save for anywhere from 30 to 60 months? Then a Trade Up CD might be something to consider. If a higher APY comes your way during your term, you’re eligible for a one-time bump. The rates are as follows: 
 
Not great, so you might look into a high-yield savings account instead.
 
U.S. Bank offers a number of credit cards, including cash back, travel, and low-interest cards. You can also find secured cards and ones for small businesses. There are also partner cards available for U.S. bank customers. Here are just some of U.S. Bank’s credit card offerings.

It also landed the top spot in two major categories: cost of service, and security and chargeback management.﻿﻿
 
Opening an account with U.S. Bank is pretty standard. You’ll need to provide a form of a government-issued ID and pop in some personal information. Got questions? Call and talk to a customer service rep. 
 The current rates for U.S. Bank’s savings accounts are quite low and not exactly anything to write home about. So if you’re looking for a high-yield savings account, you’ll want to inquire elsewhere. What’s more, it might not be for you if you have trouble meeting the balance requirements to nix the monthly account fees. However, if you’re looking for a large bank with a robust range of services and products in both personal and business banking, and you are keen on linking different accounts among its offerings, U.S. Bank could be a good choice for you. Think of U.S. Bank as a web of deposit accounts and services. If you cluster accounts in a certain way, you can tap into the full perks. It could also be worth considering if you want some of the conveniences of having deposit accounts with U.S. Bank, such as its extensive network of brick-and-mortar locations and ATMs.
