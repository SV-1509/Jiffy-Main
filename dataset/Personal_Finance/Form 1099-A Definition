Form 1099-A is one of a series of “1099” forms used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to report various nonwage payments and transactions. Form 1099-A is typically used when property has been transferred due to foreclosure.
 
Whenever a property is sold or transferred, the IRS must be informed. In a standard real estate sale, the seller receives Form 1099-S (Proceeds from Real Estate Transactions) to report the sale to the IRS. In the case of a foreclosure, the seller gets Form 1099-A (Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property).
 
Form 1099-A reports details about the sale, including the date of the transfer, the fair market value (FMV) of the property at the time of the transfer, and the loan balance on the date of the transfer. This information helps the seller determine if there is a gain or loss on the sale of the property—and if any capital gains taxes are due.﻿﻿
 
If you have lost a home or other real property to foreclosure, you will receive a copy of Form 1099-A for your records and to help you determine if there is a gain or loss on the sale of the property. If you had more than one mortgage or loan for a single property, you may receive multiple 1099-A forms.
 
To calculate the gain or loss, subtract the tax basis in the home (the purchase price less any improvements you made) from its fair market value. If you’re not liable for any debt that remains on your loan, you won’t use the fair market value; instead, you’ll use the outstanding mortgage balance at the time of foreclosure.﻿﻿
 
IRS Form 1099-A is used to notify the IRS that a property has been sold or transferred as a result of a foreclosure. The IRA advises lenders to “file Form 1099-A in the year following the calendar year in which you acquire an interest in the property or first know or have reason to know that it has been abandoned.”﻿﻿
 You can exclude up to $250,000 of gains ($500,000 for married couples filing jointly) from the sale or exchange of property owned and used as a principal residence. 
You will use the information on Form 1099-A to report the foreclosure on your tax return. Note that if the foreclosure includes a cancellation of debt, you will also receive IRS Form 1099-C.
 
All copies of Form 1099-A are available on the IRS website.﻿﻿
 
Here’s a quick rundown of Form 1099-A. The left side of the form features details about the lender and the borrower, including names, addresses, tax identification numbers, and the borrower’s account number. The right side of the form has six boxes:
 
If your home is foreclosed on, your bank or lender should send you a copy of Form 1099-A. If you haven’t received a 1099-A and believe you should have, contact your bank or lender.﻿﻿
 
There are three copies of the 1099-A. The lender files Copy A with the IRS, sends you Copy B, and retains Copy C.﻿﻿ You should receive Form 1099-A in the mail. You do not need to submit it when you file your tax return, but you should hold onto it for your records.﻿﻿
