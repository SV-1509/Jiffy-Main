The forms in the Internal Revenue Services (IRS's) 1099 series help taxpayers report monies received from a variety of sources that aren't a paycheck. Form 1099-K, "Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions," is the IRS form that taxpayers receive to report certain payment transactions.﻿﻿ If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, you report 1099-K income on Schedule C of your federal Form 1040 tax return.﻿﻿
 
You should receive Form 1099-K by Jan. 31 if, in the prior calendar year, you received payments from payment card transactions (including debit cards, credit cards, stored-value cards, or PayPal) and/or in settlement of third-party payment network transactions involving gross payments of more than $20,000 and more than 200 transactions.﻿﻿ Typically, large-volume online sellers file taxes with a 1099-K.
 
You receive a 1099-K from each payment settlement entity (PSE) from which you received income for reportable payment transactions in the previous year. That means a payment card transaction or a third-party network transaction:
 
The gross amount of a reportable payment doesn’t include adjustments for credits, cash equivalents, discount amounts, fees, refunded amounts, or any other amounts.﻿﻿
 Make sure the business income reported on your tax return correlates to the amounts on your 1099-Ks. 
It's critical that the business income reported on your tax return correlates with the amounts on your 1099-K. Check your payment card receipt records and merchant statements to confirm that the amount on your 1099-K is accurate. Also, review your records to ensure gross receipts are accurate. Do you have reported income from all forms of payment received, including cash, checks, and debit, credit, and stored-value card transactions? Backup documentation is key.
 
You may need to take special action regarding your 1099-K. Is the payee taxpayer identification number (TIN) incorrect? Is the gross amount of payment card/third party network transactions or the number of payment transactions incorrect? Does the merchant category code correctly describe your business? Does the form not belong to you? if it doesn’t, contact the PSE listed on the form to try to determine why you received the document. The name and telephone number should be on the lower left of the form.
 
If there's an error on the form—such as your Social Security number in place of your business TIN—request a corrected form from the PSE. Keep a copy of any corrected 1099-K you receive, as well as any correspondence with the PSE.

The 1099-K is an important form when you report business income on your tax return. It contains a lot of information, so verify that everything on the form is correct. If you don't, you could run into trouble. If you have questions, contact your payment settlement entity and/or work with a tax preparer or expert.
