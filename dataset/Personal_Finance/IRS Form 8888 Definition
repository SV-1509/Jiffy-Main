Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8888 lets you split your tax refund among up to three financial accounts, as well as allowing you to use it to purchase up to $5,000 in paper series I savings bonds.﻿﻿ In addition to regular bank savings and checking accounts and savings bonds, this form lets you put a portion of your refund into a mutual fund brokerage, a credit union, an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), a health savings account (HSA), an Archer MSA, a Coverdell education savings account (ESA), or a TreasuryDirect online account.﻿﻿
 
All taxpayers are allowed to use Form 8888. However, there are certain circumstances that preclude it.
 
Form 8888 should not be used if you want to deposit your refund into only one account. In that case, request direct deposit on your tax return.
 
You can't use Form 8888 to deposit a refund into an account in someone else’s name. The account must be in your name, your spouse’s name, or a joint account that includes you.
 
You may not file Form 8888 if you are also filing Form 8379 (Injured Spouse Allocation). You are also prevented from using Form 8888 with an amended tax return.﻿﻿
 Make sure your bank or financial institution accepts direct deposits, including into an individual account from a joint refund, before adding it to Form 8888. 
All pages of Form 8888 are available on the IRS website.﻿﻿
 
Request up to three savings bond registrations. Each registration must be a multiple of $50. The total of lines 4, 5a, and 6a can’t be more than the smaller of $5,000 or your refund amount.
 
All bonds will be mailed to you. Check the status of your request by contacting Treasury Retail Securities at (844) 284-2676.
 
Form 8888 is available online at the IRS Forms, Instructions & Publications website by typing “8888” in the search box. You can also obtain it by contacting your nearest IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center or checking at your local library, post office, bank, or even at some large grocery stores.
 
You can have any IRS form mailed to you by visiting the IRS Forms and Publications by U.S. Mail page online or by calling (800) TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676) Mondays through Fridays, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time—except Alaska and Hawaii; for calls from those two states the office is open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Pacific time.
 
IRS e-File and most commercial tax software programs, such as TurboTax and TaxAct, support split refunds using Form 8888. Online filing lets you direct deposit into multiple accounts and obtain your refund in 21 days or less, according to the IRS.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
