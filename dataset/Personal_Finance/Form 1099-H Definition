Form 1099-H, Health Coverage Tax Credit Advance Payments, is one of a series of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) "1099" forms used to report various nonemployee payments and transactions. Form 1099-H is used to report advance payments of qualified health insurance payments for the benefit of eligible trade adjustment assistance (TAA), alternative TAA (ATAA), reemployment TAA (RTAA), or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) payees and their qualifying family members.﻿﻿
 
You will receive Form 1099-H if your health insurance provider accepted advance payments from the Department of the Treasury on your behalf as a recipient of TAA, ATAA, RTAA, or PBGC benefits. The advance payments help you pay your monthly health insurance premiums.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Note that this is not the same as the advanced premium tax credit that some people receive through the Health Insurance Marketplace.
 
Providers of qualified health insurance coverage that receive advance payments of the health coverage tax credit (HCTC) from the Department of the Treasury on behalf of eligible recipients use Form 1099-H to report the payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If you are an HCTC recipient, you’ll get a copy of Form 1099-H.﻿﻿
 
The advance payments are part of the HCTC, a federal tax credit that can help individuals and families significantly lower their monthly health insurance premiums. You may be eligible for the HCTC if you are:
 
You are not eligible for the HCTC if you:
 
As an HCTC participant, you can pay part of your health insurance premiums to the HCTC program each month. The HCTC program will add the remaining balance and send the full payment to your health plan. Alternatively, you can make full payments to your health plan each month, then receive the HCTC as a yearly tax credit.﻿﻿ Currently, the HCTC program is set to expire as of midnight Dec. 31, 2020.﻿﻿
 You can have your HCTC benefits paid directly to your health insurance provider, or you can receive them as a yearly tax credit. 
The left side of the form includes details about the "Issuer/Provider" (your health insurance company) and the "Recipient" (you, the taxpayer), including names, addresses, and tax identification numbers. The right side of the form has 14 boxes.
 
All copies of Form 1099-H are available on the IRS website﻿﻿.
 
If you receive health coverage tax credit advance payments to help you pay for your health insurance premiums, your insurance provider will send you a copy of Form 1099-H.﻿﻿
 
Nowhere, if you are the recipient. There are three copies of Form 1099-H. The issuer sends Copy A to the IRS, Copy B to the taxpayer, and retains Copy C. You may need to report some of the information from Form 1099-H on your income tax return, but you don’t need to submit a copy with your return. You should, however, keep your copy with your tax records.﻿﻿
