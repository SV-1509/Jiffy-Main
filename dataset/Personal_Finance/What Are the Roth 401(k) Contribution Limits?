The contribution limit for a designated Roth 401(k) for 2020 is $19,500, up from $19,000 in 2019. Account-holders who are age 50 or older may make catch-up contributions of up to $6,500, for a potential total annual contribution of $26,000. Catch-up payments are additional allowed contributions that help those nearing retirement age to bulk up the account in the years before they will need the funds for regular income.
 
Employers can also make contributions to a Roth 401(k) by matching employee contributions up to a certain percentage or dollar amount. They can also make elective contributions that don't depend on employee contributions.
 
For 2020, the limit on employee and employer contributions is $57,000 or 100% of employee compensation, whichever is lower. Workers who are 50 and over can add a $6,500 catch-up contribution for a total of $63,500.﻿﻿
 
Although the contribution limits are the same for traditional 401(k) plans and their Roth counterparts, technically a designated Roth 401(k) account is a separate account within your traditional 401(k) that allows for the contribution of after-tax dollars. The elected amount is deducted from your paycheck after income, Social Security, and other applicable taxes are assessed. The contribution doesn't garner you a tax break in the year you make it.
 
The big advantage of a Roth 401(k) is that no income tax is due on these funds—or their earnings—upon their withdrawal after you retire. A traditional 401(k) works in the opposite way, where savers make their contributions on a pretax basis and pay income tax on the amounts withdrawn once they retire. Neither of these 401(k) accounts imposes income limitations for participation.
 
When available, savers may use a combination of the Roth 401(k) and the traditional 401(k) to plan for retirement. Splitting your retirement contributions between both kinds of 401(k)s, if you have the option, can help you ease your tax burden in retirement.﻿﻿
 
The question for those who also want to have a Roth IRA: Do you meet the income limits for being permitted to have one? As of 2020, the income phase-out for Roth IRA contributions starts at $124,000 for single filers and eligibility ends at $139,000. For those who are married filing jointly (and qualifying widow(er)s) in 2020, that income threshold starts at $196,000 and ends at $206,000.﻿﻿
 Roth IRA accounts have a separate annual contribution limit of $6,000 for 2019 and 2020 (up from $5,500 in 2018), with an additional $1,000 limit for catch-up contributions if you are age 50 or over (for a total of $7,000). 
 Thus, if you have both a Roth 401(k) plan and a Roth IRA, your total annual contribution for all accounts in 2020 has a combined limit of $25,500 ($19,500 Roth 401(k) contribution + $6,000 Roth IRA contribution) or $33,000 if you are 50 or older ($19,500 Roth 401(k) contribution + $6,500 catch-up contribution + $6,000 Roth IRA contribution + $1,000 catch-up contribution).
 
Roth 401(k) contributions must be made by the end of the calendar year (the 2020 contribution deadline is Dec. 31, 2020). You have a bit more time with Roth IRA contributions; you must make them by tax day, Apr. 15, 2021, to count for 2020 (and Apr. 15, 2020, for 2019).﻿﻿
 
Five years must pass from your first contribution before you can withdraw from your Roth 401(k) tax-free, and you must also be 59½ years old.﻿﻿ At 72, you are required to take minimum distributions from your Roth 401(k), but not from a Roth IRA.﻿﻿
