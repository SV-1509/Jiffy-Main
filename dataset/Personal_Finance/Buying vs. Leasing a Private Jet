If cost is no consideration, the private-jet world makes complete sense. No waiting at the airport. No crowded lines. Still, like any investment, the acquisition of a personal plane merits careful evaluation. For some, outright ownership can prove to be a logical move; for others, a lesser commitment may serve perfectly well. (For related reading, see "Economics of Owning a Small Plane")
 
There’s only one way to be in full control of your private-flying experience: acquire your own aircraft. Depending on size, range, amenities, and level of comfort, a personal plane can set you back anywhere from $3 million to $90 million. 
 
The smallest jets typically carry four passengers with a range of 2,000 to 3,000 miles (without refueling). Medium-sized models generally carry eight passengers with a range of around 7,000 miles, while the largest jets carry upwards of 12 passengers with a flying range of 4,000 miles. 
 After your initial capital outlay, expect to pay around $500,00 to $1 million in annual operation and operation costs: crew salaries, maintenance (routine and unplanned), aircraft insurance and hangarage. 
A number of savvy online aircraft cost calculators can give you a good idea of what to expect. They’re advanced enough to determine running costs based on actual utilization levels, and how financing, capital cost considerations, residual value and finance payments (where applicable) affect operating expenses.
 
If you do decide to purchase, a gamut of specialist aviation lenders and equipment financiers (including major banks) offer a range of flexible financing arrangements worth shopping around for; there are even nifty online lender calculators to help you do the numbers.
 
Outright purchasing also offers the fiscal and financial benefits of asset ownership, which includes being able to take a deduction for one of the biggest expenses of owning a plane: the aircraft's depreciation.
 
What if the numbers for a full investment outlay don't add up, but your flying hours and/or needs still justify private jet use? Leasing an aircraft offers many of the same benefits of owning one—without the long-term financial commitment. Owners often rent their planes to generate revenue when not using their aircraft themselves.
 
Dry-leasing (the most common practice) refers to leasing an aircraft without pilots, cabin crew, maintenance or insurance, and typically applies to longer timeframes; wet-leasing includes these privileges – generally for a shorter period. Either way, it is obviously much less expensive than purchasing, providing greater liquidity in the long term.
 
Lessors have the luxury of walking away at the end of the lease, without the depreciation hit owners face when they sell; they also generally have the freedom to renew their contracts, with a new private jet.
 
Leasing can also be a good way to test drive the private-plane concept before signing on any dotted lines. Aviation company Tyrus Wings offers a Try Before You Buy scheme, for example, offering access to a jet (and crew) on a short-term basis (three or six months). This way you can get a true feel for a plane, without the financial outlay and management concerns.
 
If you simply prefer the idea of a personal plane with even less financial outlay and lower monthly management fees, there are other appealing options. These plans facilitate paying on a “per flight” basis.
