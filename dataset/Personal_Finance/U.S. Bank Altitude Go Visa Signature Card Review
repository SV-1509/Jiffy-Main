The U.S. Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature card provides an excellent opportunity to maximize your rewards on dining, whether you’re eating in or taking out. The card also provides an annual streaming benefit, as well as bonus rewards on a handful of everyday spending categories. If you’re looking for a no-annual-fee card with outsized value, this one should be on your radar.
 Earn 25,000 bonus points worth $250. Just spend $1,000 within the first 90 days of account opening. Standout rewards on dining Annual bonus for streaming services No annual fee and 0% introductory APR Low base rewards rate Less value than some annual-fee cards 
The U.S. Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature card is best suited for people who spend a lot of money dining out, getting takeout, or ordering food delivery. The card’s 4X multiplier on these purchases will make it easy to rack up rewards quickly. 
 
Besides that, you’ll also get double points at grocery stores and even on grocery delivery services, which is an uncommon bonus category. So whether you’re buying food to make yourself or paying someone else to prepare your meals, you get extra points on the purchase.
 
This card could also be a good option for people who spend a lot on streaming services. While its 2% rewards rate on those purchases isn’t the best in the business—the Blue Cash Preferred card from American Express takes the crown with its 6% rewards rate (though with a $95 annual fee)—its annual streaming credit provides an added bonus. 
 
You’ll earn 25,000 bonus points if you spend $1,000 in the first 90 days on the card—that’s an effective 25% return on your spending. The bonus is worth $250 when redeemed, which is a solid value for a card with no annual fee. However, some similar cards offer one-time offers worth $150 or $200 after just $500 in spending.
 
This card offers 4 points per dollar on takeout, food delivery, and restaurant dining, as well as 2 points per dollar at grocery stores and gas stations and on grocery delivery and streaming services. Everything else earns 1 point per dollar. 
 
The dining-related bonus rewards are among the best you can find. But if you’re specifically looking for a card that offers extra points on groceries, gas, and streaming services, you can get better rewards rates with other cards.
 
U.S. Bank offers several redemption options, including cash back, gift cards, travel, and merchandise. Points are worth 1 cent apiece across all redemptions, and they never expire.
 
The best way to maximize rewards with the U.S. Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature card is to pair it with another card that offers a high rewards rate in all spending categories. If you use this card for its bonus rewards categories and the second card for everything else, you’ll always get more than 1% back on your purchases.
 
Also, be sure to spend enough in the first few months to earn the card’s one-time offer. You may not be able to do that with bonus spending alone, so plan to use the card for most of your purchases until you hit the $1,000 threshold—that’s about $333 per month for the three months.
