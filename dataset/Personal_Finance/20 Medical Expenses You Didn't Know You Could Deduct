The tax law defines medical expenses as the costs for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, and for treatments affecting any part or function of the body. Obviously, this definition covers the costs for health insurance premiums (if they aren't deducted in pre-tax dollars from your paycheck), doctors, hospital stays, diagnostic testing, prescription drugs and medical equipment. But the IRS also allows for a wide range of costs that may not fit neatly into any of these categories.
 
If you itemize your personal deductions at tax time instead of claiming the standard deduction, you can deduct a variety of healthcare and medical expenses. But you can't take them all: For tax year 2019, you can only deduct out-of-pocket expenses that total more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI).
 
It's worth tallying up any and all health-related expenses that are not covered by insurance or other reimbursement methods to see if you meet the percentage-of-AGI threshold. That 7.5% of threshold, which was set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is slated to rise to 10% in 2020. So gather ye deductions while ye may.
