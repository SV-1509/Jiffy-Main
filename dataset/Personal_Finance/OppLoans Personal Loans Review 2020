 OppLoans is a much cheaper alternative to a payday loan, as its rates are capped at 199%, while a typical payday loan APR is about 400%.﻿﻿ If you have a bad, limited, or nonexistent credit history, you may be a good fit for OppLoans, because it doesn’t use your credit history as a factor for approval. Fast funding times mean that you can get your cash as soon as the next business day.However, you may find lower APRs elsewhere. Even with a less-than-perfect credit score, you may see competitors offering APRs capped at 30%, which could save you a lot of money. For example, if you take out a $500 loan with OppLoans for 12 months at a 59% APR, you will pay a total of $173.77 in interest, whereas a 30% APR may cost you $84.92.
