The Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) is a technical indicator that identifies changing trends, breakouts, and trading opportunities in the price of an asset by combining two groups of moving averages (MA) with different time periods. There is a short-term group of MAs, and a long-term group of MA. Both contain six MAs, for a total of 12. The term gets its name from Daryl Guppy, an Australian trader who is credited with its development.
 
The Guppy indicator can use simple or exponential moving averages (EMA). EMAs are typically used. There are twelve moving averages. Insert the number of periods, N, into the calculation to find each of the MA values.

There are 12 exponential moving averages in the Guppy indicator. Repeat the steps below for each of the required moving averages. Alter the N value to calculate the EMA you want. For example, use three to calculate the three-period average, and use 60 to calculate the 60-period EMA.
 
The Guppy Multiple Moving Average can be used to identify changes in trends or gauge the strength of the current trend.
 
The degree of separation between the short- and long-term moving averages can be used as an indicator of trend strength. If there's a wide separation, then the prevailing trend is strong. Narrow separation, or lines that are crisscrossings, indicates a weakening trend or a period of consolidation.
 
The crossover of the short- and long-term moving averages represent trend reversals. If the short-term crosses above the long-term moving averages, then a bullish reversal has occurred. If the short-term MAs cross below the longer-term ones, then a bearish reversal is occurring.
 
When both groups of MAs are moving horizontally, or mostly moving sideways and heavily intertwined, it means the asset lacks a price trend, and therefore may not be a good candidate for trend trades. These periods may be good for range trading, though.
 
The indicator can also be used for trade signals. When the short-term group passes above the long-term group of MAs, buy. When the short-term group passes below the longer-term group, sell. These signals should be avoided when the price and the MAs are moving sideways. Following a consolidation period, watch for a crossover and separation. When the lines start to separate this often means a breakout from the consolidation has occurred and a new trend could be underway. During a strong uptrend, when the short-term MAs move back toward the longer-term MAs (but don't cross) and then start to move back the upside, this is another opportunity to enter into long trades in the trending direction. The same concept applies to downtrends for entering short trades.
 
Traders should use the Guppy Multiple Moving Average in conjunction with other technical indicators to maximize their odds of success. For example, traders might look at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to confirm whether a trend is getting top-heavy and poised for a reversal, or look at various chart patterns to determine other entry or exit points after a GMMA crossover.
 
The Guppy is composed of 12 EMAs, so essentially the Guppy and an EMA are the same thing. The Guppy is a collection of EMAs that the creator believed helped isolate trades, spot opportunities, and warn about price reversals. The multiple lines of the Guppy help some traders see the strength or weakness in a trend better than if only using one or two EMAs.
 
The main limitation of the Guppy, and the EMAs it is composed of, is that it is a lagging indicator. Each EMA represents the average price from the past. It does not predict the future. Waiting for the averages to crossover can at times mean an entry or exit that is far too late, as the price has already moved aggressively. All moving averages are also prone to whipsaws. This is when there is a crossover, potentially resulting in a trade, but the price doesn't move as expected and then the averages cross again resulting in a loss.
