Gross receipts are sales of a business that form the basis for corporate taxation in a handful of individual states and certain local tax authorities. The components of gross receipts vary by state and municipality.
 
Gross receipts include income to a business from all sources without any deductions. Unlike gross sales, gross receipts capture anything that is not related to the normal business activity of an entity â€” tax refunds, donations, interest and dividend income, and others.

Ohio Revised Code Section 5751.01 defines gross receipts for the purposes of Commercial Activity Tax ("CAT") as "the total amount realized by a person, without deduction for the cost of goods sold or other expenses incurred, that contributes to the production of gross income of the person, including the fair market value of any property and any services received, and any debt transferred or forgiven as consideration."
 
Like the above, definitions of "gross receipts" are given by other tax authorities that use them as a taxation basis for businesses. Detailed lists of exclusions to gross receipts are also provided.
