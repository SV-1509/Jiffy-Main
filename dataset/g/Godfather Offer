A Godfather offer is an irrefutable takeover offer made to a target company by an acquiring company. Typically, the acquisition price's premium is extremely generous compared to the prevailing market price. Therefore, if the target company's management refuses the offer, shareholders may initiate lawsuits or other forms of revolt against the target company for not performing their fiduciary duty of looking out for the best interests of the shareholders.
 
A Godfather offer is even harder for the target company's management to refuse when its stock price has been flat or declining for an extended period of time, as long-time investors would jump at the opportunity to cash out at an elevated price.
 
In essence, the idea of a Godfather offer isn't so much an offer as a sly, yet heavy-handed demand: do as I say, or else.
 
The expression comes from the famous line — "make him an offer he can't refuse" — featured in the Godfather trilogy. It is now one of the most celebrated quotations from an American film.
