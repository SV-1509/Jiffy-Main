Form 1099-DIV: Dividends and Distributions is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form sent by banks and other financial institutions to investors who receive dividends and distributions from any type of investment during a calendar year. Investors can receive multiple 1099-DIVs. Each 1099-DIV form should be reported on an investor’s tax filing.﻿﻿
 
Certain types of investment accounts are exempt from issuing a Form 1099-DIV. Exempt accounts include individual retirement accounts (IRAs), money purchase pension plans, profit-sharing plans, and various retirement accounts. Investors typically will not receive a 1099-DIV form if cumulative dividends are not greater than $10.﻿﻿
 
Banks, investment companies, and other financial institutions are required to provide taxpayers with a 1099-DIV by Jan. 31 each year. Companies provide a copy of the Form 1099-DIV to the investor and to the IRS.﻿﻿
 
Most investors who receive a Form 1099-DIV will have ordinary dividends, qualified dividends, or total capital gains.
 
Other categories for investors include unrecaptured section 1250 gain, section 1202 gain, collectibles gain, non-dividend distributions, federal income tax withheld, investment expenses, foreign tax paid, foreign country or U.S. possession, cash liquidation distributions, non-cash liquidation distributions, exempt-interest dividends, specified private activity bond interest dividends, and state tax withheld.﻿﻿
 
Investors may also be subject to Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) filing requirements for foreign accounts. This is a law that requires U.S. citizens, both in the country and abroad, to file reports on foreign account holdings.﻿﻿
 Foreign account holdings must be reported in U.S. dollars. 
Taxpayers are required to file the information on each Form 1099-DIV they receive on their annual tax form. This can be done on a Schedule B form or directly on Form 1040. Taxpayers who receive more than $1,500 in taxable interest and/or ordinary dividends during the year are required to fill out Schedule B, which accompanies a 1040 form.﻿﻿
 
Dividends are taxed at an investor’s income tax rate with a few exceptions. Qualified dividends are the primary exception. Qualified dividends have met certain criteria that allow them to be taxed at a lower capital gains tax rate.﻿﻿
 
The tax rate on capital gains may also vary from the ordinary income tax rate. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, but taxes on long-term capital gains are lower.﻿﻿
