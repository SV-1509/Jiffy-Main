Form 5405, First-Time Homebuyer Credit and Repayment of the Credit was a tax form distributed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and used by first-time homeowners or long-time residents of a home to claim a tax credit that was available from April 9, 2008, through September 2010.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ First-time homebuyers applying for the credit could not have owned another home within three years of the new home purchase, and either the purchase price of the home or the homebuyer's modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) could not exceed a certain threshold. The amount of the credit was the lesser of either a fixed percentage of the home's purchase price or a fixed dollar value.﻿﻿
 
If the property the credit was received for was sold within 36 months of the purchase date or if the home was no longer the taxpayer's main home, the homeowner was generally responsible for repaying the full credit.﻿﻿
 
Form 5405, First-Time Homebuyer Credit and Repayment of the Credit, was the form used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to allow the homebuyer taxpayer to claim a tax credit for a percentage of the purchase price of a new home during the time period from April 9, 2008, through September 2010.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ When the program began in 2008, the allowable tax credit was 10 percent of the purchase price of the home up to a cap of $7,500, and the cap went up to $8,000 in 2009.﻿﻿ Homes with purchase prices of at least $75,000 to $80,000 allowed the homebuyer to claim the full tax credit.﻿﻿
 
A first-time homebuyer tax credit could provide the taxpayer with a refund even if no taxes were owed, as there was no lower limit on income so a person without an income significant enough to be taxed could still buy a home and claim the first-time homebuyer tax credit.﻿﻿
 Form 5405: First-Time Homebuyer Credit And Repayment of the Credit first-time homebuyer tax credit is no longer available; it was available from April 9, 2008, through September 30, 2010. 
Form 5405 was attached to the homebuyer's tax return, along with a copy of the settlement statement, which is typically the HUD-1 Form. The form contained all parties' names, signatures, the property's address, the purchase date, and the purchase price. Some types of homes, such as mobile homes, could use other forms of contracts to demonstrate that the property met requirements for the credit.﻿﻿
 
Qualified homebuyers who purchased a qualified home but did not claim the tax credit on their 2009 returns were encouraged to file an amended 1040X return with Form 5405 attached to claim their credit.﻿﻿
 
In November 2019, Form 5405 was revised to facilitate repayment of the first-time homebuyer tax credits, which Form 5405 was originally created to facilitate between 2008 and 2010. The repayment requirement continues to apply to homes purchased in 2008. The purpose of the newly revised Form 5405:
