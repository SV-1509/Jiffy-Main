Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form taxpayers use to report non-employee compensation. This is generally a business payment—not a personal payment.
 
Independent contractors, freelancers, sole-proprietors, and self-employed individuals, for example, receive one from each client who paid them $600 or more in a calendar year. The form is also used to report miscellaneous compensation such as rents, prizes, awards, healthcare payments, and payments to an attorney.﻿﻿
 
A 1099-MISC form is one of many in the 1099 series and among the most commonly used. Taxpayers receive 1099s, including Form 1099-MISC, shortly after the end of the tax year.﻿﻿ 
 
Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income is completed and sent out by someone who has paid at least $10 in royalties or broker payments instead of dividends or tax-exempt interest to another individual. The form is also sent to anyone who received at least $600 in:
 
This form can also be used to report earnings from direct sales of at least $5,000 of consumer products to a buyer for resale anywhere other than a permanent retail establishment.﻿﻿
 
The payer must send the form to the recipient and IRS by Jan. 31. The recipient can attach the form to their tax return.﻿﻿
 If you earned less than $600 and do not have a 1099-MISC, you must still report your income to the IRS.

The payer includes their name, address, and identification number, as well as the recipient's name, address, and Social Security number.
 
A 1099-MISC form also has a series of boxes in which the payer will input whichever type of payment was made. That may include Rents in Box 1, Royalties in Box 2, or Non-Employee Compensation in Box 7. Other boxes that may be filled out include Box 4: Federal Income Tax Withheld and Box 16: State Tax Withheld.﻿﻿
 
All copies of Form 1099-MISC are available on the IRS website.﻿﻿
 
The IRS is overhauling Form 1099-MISC in 2020. It will introduce a new form, called 1099-NEC: Non-Employee Compensation, starting in the 2020 tax year.﻿﻿ Form 1099-NEC will be used to report payments to non-employees currently reported in Box 7 of Form 1099-MISC. For tax year 2019, make sure to use the 2019 version of Form 1099-MISC.
