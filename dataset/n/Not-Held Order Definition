A not-held order, usually a market or limit order, gives the broker, or floor trader, both time and price discretion to get the best possible price.
 
An investor placing a not-held order is trusting that the floor trader can obtain a better market price than what the investor can get by accessing the market on their own. Although the floor trader has price and time discretion, they are not responsible for any losses that the shareholder may suffer with this type of order.
 
Not-held orders are most common when trading international equities. The opposite of a not-held order is a held order, which is the order that most investors are more familiar with, and one that demands immediate execution.
 
Floor traders have the benefit of seeing order flows and trading patterns, which often gives them an edge when determining the best price and time to execute a customer’s order. For example, a trader may notice a recurring spike in volume on the buy side of the order book that suggests a stock’s price is likely to continue rising. This would result in the trader executing a client’s not-held order sooner, rather than later. They may also have other customer orders that they can cross simultaneously.
 
Once the investor gives a not-held order to the trader, they are placing full confidence in that individual to execute the trade at the best possible price. The investor cannot dispute the trade execution, provided that the broker met all regulatory requirements. For instance, if a shareholder thinks the broker shouldn't have executed their not-held order before an FOMC interest rate announcement, they cannot seek a rebooking.
