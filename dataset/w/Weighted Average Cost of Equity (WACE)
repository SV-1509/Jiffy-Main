Weighted average cost of equity (WACE) is a way to calculate the cost of a company's equity that gives different weight to different aspects of the equities. Instead of lumping retained earnings, common stock, and preferred stock together, WACE provides a more accurate idea of a company’s total cost of equity. Determining an accurate cost of equity for a firm is integral for the firm to be able to calculate its cost of capital.
 
In turn, an accurate measure of the cost of capital is essential when a firm is trying to decide if a future project will be profitable or not.
 
Here is an example of how to calculate the WACE:
 
WACE = (.24*.50) + (.10*.25) + (.20*.25) = 0.195 or 19.5%
 
Potential buyers who are considering acquiring a company might use the weighted average cost of equity to help them assign a value to the future cash flows of the target company. The results of this formula might be coupled with other indicators, such as the after-tax cost of debt to form an assessment. These results, in combination, are used to determine the weighted average cost of capital.
 
Furthermore, the WACE calculation can be used within the company to better assess how its campaigns and capital-intensive projects translate it into the overall return on earnings for the shareholders. After taking such an assessment, it is possible that the management may receive a directive from its board of directors to adopt new approaches that would improve the results, and free up more capital. This might also temper the company’s issuance of new stock if it is attempting to raise more capital, especially if the introduction of such a plan would negatively affect results.
