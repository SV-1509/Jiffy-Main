The W.P. Carey School of Business is a business school that is part of the Arizona State University System. Previously known as the Arizona State University Department of Commerce, it received its current name following a $50 million donation by the W.P. Carey Foundation.
 
The school ranks highly in domestic and international university rankings, often scoring in the top 50 among business schools and in the top 100 among schools overall.
 
Today, the W.P. Carey School of Business is home to an academic staff of over 250, and is attended by over 15,000 students. Its namesake benefactor, William Polk Carey, was a prominent businessman and philanthropist who founded the New York-based real estate firm, W.P. Carey & Co. Prior to his donation to the W.P. Carey School of Business, he also donated funds to the Carey School of Law at the University of Maryland, and the Carey Business School at Johns Hopkins University.
 
Originally founded in 1961, the W.P Carey School of Business is located in Tempe, Arizona. It offers a well known Master of Business Administration (MBA) program in different formats, including an online degree. Other Master’s degrees are also offered, in areas such as accounting, data science, finance, logistics, and real estate development.
 
One unique attribute of the W.P. Carey School of Business is its emphasis on the personal development of its students and alumni. In their first term, students are required to write an “Individual Development Plan”, outlining their approach for developing desired leadership qualities.
 
The W.P. Carey School of Business received widespread acclaim in 2015 when it announced a new program to provide tuition-free MBA program for its incoming class of students. The move was part of the university’s efforts to increase diversity in its student body by decreasing the financial barriers faced by incoming students.
 
The university is also notable for its large alumni community, which is over 100,000 individuals in 2019. Among them are many prominent figures in a diverse range of industries, such as Michael Ahearn, CEO of First Solar (FSLR); Bill Post , CEO of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW); and Eric Crown, co-founder of Insight Enterprises (NSIT).
