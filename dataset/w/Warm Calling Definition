Warm calling is the solicitation of a potential customer with whom a sales representative in particular, or his firm in general, has had prior contact. It refers to a sales call, visit or email that is preceded by some sort of contact with the prospect, such as a direct mail campaign, an introduction at a business event or a referral.
 
Warm calling is the opposite of cold callingâ€”the solicitation of prospects who were not anticipating such an interaction, with whom the sales representative or business has not had prior contact.
 You don't have to sell to the prospect during a warm call; in fact, it may be better to use it to set up an appointment or virtual meeting instead. 
Warm calling tends to have a personalized element since the prior contact can be referenced or mentioned (such as "Hi, Mrs. Jones, I saw you followed our company on Twitter" or "Hi, Mr. Jones, we met last week at the ABC Conference"). The previous contact acts as an icebreaker for the follow-up warm call. Warm calling works best on prospects that check all the customer suitability boxes even though they have not expressed any interest in a product or service yet.
 
Warm calling and the use of effective sales channels such as email, text message marketing, and social media portals are considered to be more efficient and effective than cold calling in generating new leads. Modern social media portals such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook also allow opportunities for potential clients to reach out indirectly or directly to businesses by posting comments on a blog, sharing an article with a peer or tweeting something that is of interest.
