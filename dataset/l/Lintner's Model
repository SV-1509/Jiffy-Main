The following formula describes a mature corporation’s dividend payout:
 
Where:
 
In 1956, John Lintner developed this dividend model through inductive research with 28 large, public manufacturing firms. Today, although Lintner passed away years ago, his model remains the accepted starting point for understanding how companies’ dividends behave over time.
 
Lintner observed the following important facets of corporate dividend policies:
 
While all companies wish to sustain a constant dividend payout to maximize shareholder wealth, natural business fluctuations force companies to project the dividends in the long run, based on their target payout ratio.

The three main approaches to corporate dividend policy are as follows:
