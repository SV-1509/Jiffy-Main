An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that may consist of stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, or other financial assets. By design, ETFs strive to offer more liquidity and trading flexibility than other investment vehicles. That is because they are bought and sold on an exchange, much like individual stocks, where supply and demand continually dictate share prices. Investors can make trades during normal market hours in response to new market conditions or changing expectations.
