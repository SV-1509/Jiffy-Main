Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) is an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company based in San Diego, California. The company designs and distributes wireless telecommunications products globally. In October 2016, Qualcomm made a move to expand overseas by announcing a bid for the Dutch semiconductor company NXP Semiconductors S.V. (NXPI). Two years later, in July 2018, the $44 billion bid to acquire NXP was dissolved after it failed to gain regulatory approval in China.
 
Qualcomm reported Q4 2018 earnings on November 7, 2018. The telecommunications giant reported $5.8 billion in revenues this quarter, compared to $5.96 billion over the same period last year.
