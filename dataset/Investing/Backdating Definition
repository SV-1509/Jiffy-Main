Backdating is the practice of marking a document, whether a check, contract, or another legally binding document, with a date that is prior to what it should be.

Here are a few examples of situations where backdating may be acceptable:
 
In the 2000s, there was a spate of backdating stock options, mostly at technology firms that rely heavily on stock options for executive compensation, but also at some companies not in the tech sector. The backdating scheme involved moving the effective date for exercising the options from when the options were 'out of the money' to a date that made the options 'in the money' to allow certain executives to exercise their options profitably.
 
Companies such as Comverse, Verisign (VRSN), F5 Networks (FFIV), Intuit (INTU), and McAfee (now Intel (INTC))—as well as Home Depot (HD), Michael's Stores (MLK), and UnitedHealth Group (UNH), to name a few—all engaged in this fraudulent activity to varying degrees and were forced to pay fines and penalties and conduct time-consuming and expensive restatements of their books.
