CANSLIM, created by Investor's Business Daily William J. O'Neil, is a system for selecting growth stocks using a combination of fundamental and technical analysis techniques.
 
CANSLIM, also referred to as "C-A-N-S-L-I-M" or "CAN SLIM," identifies a process that investors can use to pick stocks poised to grow faster than average. Each letter in the acronym stands for a key factor to look for when purchasing shares in a company.
 
The seven criteria that comprise CANSLIM are as follows:
 
CANSLIM is a bullish strategy for fast markets, so it may not be for everyone. The idea is to get into high-growth stocks before the institutional funds are fully invested.
 
All the elements of CANSLIM can be read as a wish list for fund managers seeking growth, so it is a matter of time until the buying demand increases. The catch is that stocks that fit the CANSLIM strategy can be among the fastest to drop if the market direction shifts and funds prioritize safe havens.
 
In short, CANSLIM is a good fit for experienced investors with a higher risk tolerance. These stocks cannot be bought and simply held as much of the value is being priced in for future growth, meaning any slowing in the growth trajectory, or the market as a whole, may result in the stock being punished.
