Coca-Cola soda began in 1886 when Atlanta pharmacist Dr. John S. Pemberton created the now-famous soft drink, which was sold in the soda fountain of a pharmacy. The unique drink had moderate success, averaging nine servings per day. Prior to his death, he sold the majority of his stake to Asa Candler, an Atlanta businessman, who incorporated The Coca-Cola Company (KO) in 1892.﻿﻿
 
Candler expanded distribution to soda fountains all over the country. As demand for the soda grew, Joseph Biedenharn installed bottling machinery in the back of his pharmacy in Mississippi, becoming the first to bottle Coca-Cola.﻿﻿
