General Electric Company (GE) ranked 48th on the Fortune 500 list for 2019, even as its stock price has sagged after a series of negative quarterly earnings. General Electric is one of America's most recognized brand with a market capitalization of $70.4 billion as of March 31, 2020. The company produces products ranging from toasters and clock radios to healthcare devices to the GEnx jet engine for the Boeing 787 aircraft.
 
On Oct. 1, 2018, GE announced that H. Lawrence Culp replaced John Flannery as Chairman and CEO of the company. He was replaced after roughly one year in the position as mounting losses continued to pressure the company to make structural change. Between factory closings, employee layoffs, and business consolidations, GE has weathered its fair share of storms, but on Dec. 13, 2018 market analysts threw the company a bone. JPMorgan raised its two-year rating on GE to "neutral" from "underweight," causing GE to surge by 12.7 percent to $7.52 a share before market open. The run is set to become the company's largest one-day rally in more than five years. Later, on Dec. 19 2018, General Electric surged more than 8 percent on news that the company had filed paperwork for a 2019 IPO for its health-care unit, GE Healthcare. A public offering would make GE Healthcare, which generated $19 billion in revenue last year, one of the largest public health-care companies in the world.
 
Since then, the share price has fluctuated a great deal. It reach a near-term high of nearly $13 in February 2020, before losing more than 50% of its value to just $6.11 a share in March 2020, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
