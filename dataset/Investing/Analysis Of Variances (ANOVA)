Analysis of variances (ANOVA) is used in finance in several different ways, such as to forecast the movements of security prices by first determining which factors influence stock fluctuations. This analysis can provide valuable insight into the behavior of a security or market index under various conditions.
 
Analysis of variances (ANOVA) statistical models were initially introduced in a scientific paper written by Richard Fisher, a British mathematician, in the early 20th century. He is credited with first introducing the term variance.
 
ANOVA testing does not just examine the differences, it also looks at the degree of variance, or the difference between them, in variable means. It is a way of analyzing the statistical significance of the variables. ANOVA analysis is considered to be more accurate than t-testing because it is more flexible and requires fewer observations. It is also better suited for use in more complex analyses than those that can be assessed by conducting tests. Additionally, ANOVA testing allows researchers to uncover relationships among variables, while a t-test does not. Variations of ANOVA testing include One-Way ANOVA (used to search for statistically significant differences between two or more independent variables), Two-Way ANOVA (to uncover potential interaction of two independent variables on one dependent variable) and Factorial ANOVA, which typically involves assessing two or more factors or variables with two levels.

This type of analysis attempts to break down the various underlying factors that determine the price of securities as well as market behavior. For example, it could possibly show how much of a security's rise or fall is due to changes in interest rates. A t-test and f-test are used to analyze the results of an analysis of variance test to determine which variables are of statistical significance.
 
In addition to its applications in the finance industry, ANOVA is also used to test hypotheses in reviewing clinical trial data, for example, to compare the effects of different treatment protocols on patient outcomes; in social science research (for instance to assess the effects of gender and class on specified variables), in software engineering (for instance to evaluate database management systems), in manufacturing (to assess product and process quality metrics) and industrial design among other fields.
