Facebook, Inc. (FB) has established itself as the leading social media giant with a market capitalization of $536 billion as of October 25, 2019.﻿﻿ When Facebook issued its initial public offering (IPO) on May 18, 2012, many mutual funds had already snapped up shares on the private market.﻿﻿ After that, these funds spread their shares of Facebook across many funds.
 
Although Facebook's stock price has gone on a roller-coaster ride, those funds that held on to shares benefited from its high growth rate. It is important to note that these funds have ownership of the Facebook Class A shares, and not the Facebook Class B shares, which carry heavier voting rights.
