Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are growing ever more popular. The investment vehicle was created to combine the best characteristics of both stocks and mutual funds into a combined investment structure, while hopefully leaving out some of the less desirable ones. There are some drawbacks, though, as no investment vehicle is perfect for everyone.
 
An ETF is a marketable security that trades on an exchange. It is what is called a basket of assets (such as stocks, bonds, commodities, etc) that tracks a benchmark. Four of the common advantages of ETFs over mutual funds include the following:
 
Of course, no investment vehicle is perfect for everyone, and ETFs are no exception. Some ETFs are overly concentrated, actively traded ETFs can be expensive, ETFs may contribute to market instability, and many ETFs are based on unproven models.

This means the investments track an index, such as the S&P 500. The ability of the manager to “drift” from the index is extremely difficult. Mutual funds are typically actively managed, which means investments are chosen by a portfolio manager. This allows the possibility for a manager to stray from the original investment objective over time. Transparency: Because ETFs track a specific index, securities owned are transparent. Mutual funds buy and sell securities at various times and amounts, so the securities and percentage of holdings will vary over time. Mutual funds are only required to report their holdings quarterly.
