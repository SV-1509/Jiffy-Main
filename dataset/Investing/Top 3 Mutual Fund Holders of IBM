International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) began in 1911, from the merger of three manufacturing businesses by financier Charles Flint. At the time, the company was named The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company and had $800,000 in net income. The company sold time clocks, computing scales and tabulating machines, which were the precursors to calculators and mainframe computers. 
 
With the exception of the tabulating machines, business was stagnant until Thomas Watson Sr. came on board as the company's first CEO in 1914. Watson galvanized the corporate culture and spearheaded IBM's transformation into an information technology company, capitalizing on the success of the tabulating machine. The company expanded distribution of products globally and aptly renamed itself International Business Machines. IBM evolved into a global information technology products and services giant with revenues of $79.1 billion in 2017. IBM's popular cognitive technology platform "Watson" was named in recognition of Thomas Watson Sr.
