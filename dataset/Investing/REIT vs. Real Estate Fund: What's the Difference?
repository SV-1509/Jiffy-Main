A REIT is a corporation, trust, or association that invests directly in income-producing real estate and is traded like a stock. A real estate fund is a type of mutual fund that primarily focuses on investing in securities offered by public real estate companies. While you can use either to diversify your investment portfolio, there are key differences to know.
 
A REIT's mode of operation is similar to that of a mutual fund in that investors combine their capital to buy a share of commercial real estate and then earn income from their shares. REITs are required to pay a minimum of 90% of taxable income in the form of shareholder dividends each year. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn income from real estate—without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.
 
There are three main types of REITs:
 
The majority of revenue associated with equity REITs comes from real estate property rent, while the revenue associated with mortgage REITs is generated from the interest earned on mortgage loans.
 
REIT portfolios may include apartment complexes, data centers, healthcare facilities, hotels, infrastructure, office buildings, retail centers, self-storage, timberland, and warehouses.

Like regular mutual funds, real estate funds can be either actively or passively managed. Those that are passively managed typically track the performance of a benchmark index. For example, the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund (VGSIX), which invests in REITs that buy office buildings, hotels, and other properties, tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index.﻿﻿
 
There are three types of real estate funds:
 
Real estate funds invest primarily in REITs and real estate operating companies; however, some real estate funds invest directly in properties. Real estate funds gain value mostly through appreciation and generally do not provide short-term income to investors the same way that REITs might. Still, real estate funds can offer a much broader asset selection (and diversification) than buying individual REITs.
 
Here's a look at the key differences between REITs and real estate funds:
 
REITs and real estate mutual funds offer investors a way to access real estate without the need to own, operate, or finance properties. In general, REITs can provide a steady source of income through dividends. Real estate funds, on the other hand, create much of their value through appreciation, which makes them attractive to longer-term investors.
