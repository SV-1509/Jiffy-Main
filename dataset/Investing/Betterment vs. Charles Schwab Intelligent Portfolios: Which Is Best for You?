Betterment and Charles Schwab are approaching the robo-advisory space from very different starting points. Betterment is one of the pioneering robo-advisors and has evolved to offer human advice rather than a firm, digital-only approach. In contrast, Charles Schwab is a storied financial firm that made its name providing advice to individual investors since the 1970s.﻿﻿ It has become more digital-savvy over the years, of course, and is already a force in the online brokerage space. Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios is another step in that evolution. Both of these firms have created solid offerings, so picking between Betterment and Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios can be challenging. We’ll look at some of the key things to consider in deciding which is best for your investment dollars.
 On November 25, 2019, Charles Schwab announced a buyout of TD Ameritrade’s online brokerage. The transaction itself is expected to close in the second half of 2020, and in the meantime, the two firms will operate autonomously. Schwab expects the merger of its platforms and services to take place within three years of the close of the deal.﻿﻿ 
Betterment's goal planning and tracking is more obvious than with Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.
 
Betterment has very easy-to-follow steps for setting goals, and each one can be monitored separately. You can set up a variety of goals with different target dates, and the portfolios will vary considerably. Your asset allocation is displayed in a ring with equities in shades of green and fixed income in shades of blue. If you’re falling behind on meeting a goal you’ve set, you’re encouraged to put more aside. 
 
Schwab's offering has few goal-setting tools available besides a limited college expense lookup. Each account has a single pot of money, but you can have up to 10 accounts dedicated to different goals.﻿﻿ Once you’ve defined your own goal, the what-if analysis capabilities let you stress-test the plan by changing your retirement age or monthly savings. You can also look at the potential impact of changes in market returns. The dashboard built into the website and mobile app offers a quick look at your performance to date. There are additional goal-setting capabilities for the premium product, including unlimited access to financial planners. The analysis capabilities and tools suggest that the logic is already there to allow interested clients to provide more detail and get a better targeted portfolio.
 
As part of the account setup, Betterment prompts you to connect external accounts, such as bank and brokerage holdings, to your account both to provide a complete picture of your assets and to make cash transfers into your investment portfolio easier. Each goal you’ve set can be invested in a different strategy, so your longer-term goals, such as retirement, can have higher risk than a shorter-term goal, such as funding a down payment on a house. 
 
As mentioned, Schwab allows you to stress-test your retirement plan by raising or lowering your retirement age or your monthly savings. This type of scenario testing is very useful, particularly if more immediate financial concerns are eating away at your ability to plan for retirement. Once you're retired, the allocation is focused on fixed income, so you can still be accruing gains while withdrawing funds.

Against most robo-advisors, Betterment has the edge on fees. However, this is not the case when compared to Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.
 
Betterment has two plans available: a Digital plan, which assesses an annual fee of 0.25% with a $0 minimum balance, and a Premium plan, with a 0.40% annual fee and a $100,000 minimum balance. The Digital plan includes personalized advice, automatic rebalancing, and tax-saving strategies, while the Premium plan also offers advice on assets held outside Betterment, and guidance on life events such as getting married, having a child, or retiring.﻿﻿
 
Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios’ 0.0% management fee will attract younger investors, although the relatively high $5,000 minimum may prove a barrier for some. The portfolios include low-cost ETFs with management fees of 0.08%-0.2%, so this is effectively what you pay in terms of total fees. Schwab's premium service, with unlimited access to financial planners, charges a setup fee of $300 plus a monthly fee of $30 once you've attained the $25,000 minimum.﻿﻿
 
While Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios wins the battle of the fees, Betterment is the obvious winner in terms of minimum deposits. Intelligent Portfolios requires investors to deposit at least $5,000 while Betterment has no minimum deposit at all.
 
Betterment offers five portfolio types based upon classic Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) principles and/or specific investment themes:
 
Betterment accounts are rebalanced dynamically when they deviate from their intended goal allocations. Portfolios get more conservative as the target date approaches, with the goal of locking-in gains and avoiding major losses.
 
Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios are made up of ETFs, the majority of which are managed by Schwab. Schwab does not offer a socially responsible portfolio option or any other customization beyond matching a portfolio to your risk tolerance and stated goals. The interesting thing about Intelligent Portfolios is that the asset classes reach beyond stocks and bonds and into real estate investment trusts, high yield corporate bonds, and precious metals. The inclusion of these riskier asset classes actually improves the true market diversification of the Intelligent Portfolios. Intelligent Portfolios are rebalanced by an algorithm that takes tax implications into account. A portfolio rebalance is triggered whenever the asset allocation drifts from its defined allocation. This could happen at any time depending on deposits, withdrawals, and market activity. Accounts are monitored daily for drift.﻿﻿
 
All Betterment accounts are eligible for tax-loss harvesting.﻿﻿ At Schwab, tax-loss harvesting is available for clients with more than $50,000 in their Intelligent Portfolios account, and they must enroll in the service to enable it.﻿﻿
 
Betterment and Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios both have sufficient security. Betterment and Charles Schwab both utilize heavy-duty 256-bit SSL encryption on their websites. Fingerprint, face recognition, and two-factor authentication are available on mobile devices.﻿﻿﻿﻿ 
 
There is no excess SIPC insurance carried by Betterment, but trades are cleared through Apex Clearing, which has risk management tools in place.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Betterment clients are not placing risky trades, and there is no margin lending offered, so it’s unlikely that there would be a need for additional SIPC coverage. Still, if your account has more than $500,000 in it, or more than $250,000 in cash, you might consider moving the excess to a firm with additional insurance.
 
Schwab's accounts are insured by SIPC up to $500,000, with additional insurance provided up to an aggregate limit of $600,000,000.﻿﻿
 
Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios actually has the edge over Betterment in terms of customer service.
 
Betterment's customer service is available from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday.﻿﻿ You can get help from financial planners at any time with a Premium account, but you’ll pay a fee of $199-299 to consult a planner if you have a basic account.﻿﻿ There is no online chat capability at Betterment.
 
Schwab has online chat available, and you can make an appointment to talk to a financial advisor at any time for a quick one-on-one. Clients of the premium product have additional access to financial advisors. Most importantly, technical support is available 24/7.﻿﻿
 
Betterment ranks near the top of our robo-advisor rankings for good reason. It has an excellent account setup process, great goal planning, and an overall exceptional user experience. In that context, it is impressive that Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios is so competitive with Betterment in other areas. However, Intelligent Portfolios is hurt by its high account minimum of $5,000 at the same time as it is helped by its aggressive zero-fee approach. In the end, Betterment is the better choice for the average investor, but this will be a match to watch as both robo-advisors continue to evolve.
