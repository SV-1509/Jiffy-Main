Wealthfront and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services are among the top robo-advisor options in our review, with both scoring highly. While there are upsides to both services, the right one for you will depend on your digital-versus-human preference, the amount you have to invest, and your desire to fine-tune your portfolio.
 
Although both Wealthfront and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services are robo-advisors, their offerings and services will appeal to (and be appropriate for) different audiences.
 
If you’re newer to the investing game, Wealthfront’s top-notch planning tools and small minimum investment make it a good choice, despite a portfolio with limited customization options. It also scored the highest ratings in our robo-advisor reviews, with 4.4 stars and some great advantages.
 
For mature investors looking to place capital at a financial institution with a long and stable history, Vanguard Personal Advisor Services may be an excellent fit, as long as clients are prepared to pay extra for transaction costs and third-party relationships.
 
Vanguard and Wealthfront both offer goal planning and tracking, but Wealthfront has a clear edge.
 
Wealthfront’s planning tools are excellent. The dashboard displays your assets and liabilities, giving you a quick look at the likelihood of attaining your goals. The company connects to Redfin to help prospective homeowners determine how much a school will cost in their desired neighborhood. College savings scenarios have cost estimates for numerous U.S.-based universities, and expense projections include not just tuition, but room and board as well as other costs. You even determine how long you could take a sabbatical from work and travel while still making other goals work. There’s a wedding planning goal, and a database that tells you how much your ideal car will cost.
 
At Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, the site provides ample goal planning resources that include checklists, how-to articles, and calculators. Clients can apply these tools to estimate their total costs of retirement, perform a top-down review of assets, and plan major life goals that include college savings, home ownership, or a rainy day fund. Long-term forecasts and recommendations in the account interface coach clients on how to better meet investing objectives based on life situations and goals outlined during the lengthy onboarding process. The client can make changes at any time by altering the risk profile.
 
Both Wealthfront and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services offer a few options for retirement accounts, including traditional and Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and 401(k) rollovers.
 
At Wealthfront, the robo-advisor uses your information to estimate your net worth at retirement and what you could comfortably spend per month during your golden years. Their Path planning tool helps you compare your projected retirement income against your current spending habits so you’ll be able to see whether you can maintain your lifestyle later. You can change various inputs such as retirement age, savings, target retirement spending and life expectancy to see how they affect the outcome.
 
Vanguard’s website features an impressive variety of tools and calculators to help clients figure out how much money needs to be set aside to reach goals (such as retirement) within realistic time frames.
 
Wealthfront and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services offer a similar mix of taxable and retirement accounts. Here again, however, Wealthfront has a wider offering, with 529 college savings plan accounts being a key difference. At this time, neither Vanguard nor Wealthfront offer custodial accounts known as Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts.

Wealthfront and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services vary quite a bit in terms of features, and this is reflective of the different customers each is targeting. Wealthfront focuses on a younger crowd that is comfortable with technology. Vanguard Personal Advisor Services has features aimed at higher net worth clients who are likely older and may need more human contact when it comes to being confident in the management of their portfolio. 
 
Wealthfront and Vanguard are both competitive in the industry when it comes to fees, but here again, Wealthfront has the edge.
 
Wealthfront’s fee structure is simple: 0.25% of your portfolio, assessed monthly. There are no fees charged for cash balances. The ETFs that make up most of the portfolios have annual management fees of 0.08%. Larger portfolios enrolled in the Smart Beta program may be invested in funds with slightly higher management fees.
 
Vanguard Personal Advisor Services charges a competitive 0.30% advisory fee, paid quarterly, but hidden costs may add up since clients also pay transaction fees. The broker has also entered into payment for order flow deals with third-party mutual funds, and the client foots the bill for those fees as well. The average expense ratio of underlying investments is 0.11 percent.
 
Wealthfront has a competitive advantage over Vanguard when it comes to minimum deposits. Vanguard's robo-advisor requires you to have $50,000 as a minimum whereas Wealthfront requires just $500. Again, this is due to the two services having different customers in mind, but it makes Wealthfront the more attractive robo-advisor to try out. Testing out Vanguard requires 100 times more capital. 
 
Wealthfront and Vanguard Personal Advisory Services differ greatly in how long it takes to get your portfolio started.
 
Getting started with a Wealthfront account is fairly straightforward, though the brokerage won’t show you portfolio allocations before you give them some personal information. Link a checking account and answer some questions to help pinpoint your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. While you can see the exact portfolio you’d be funding, you’re not able to customize it. Customers with more than $100,000 in their accounts can choose a stock portfolio rather than a portfolio of ETFs.
 
At Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, the up-front work is similar, but the timeline is lengthy. You’ll answer detailed questions regarding age, assets, retirement dates, risk tolerance, and market experience, generating a proposed portfolio allocation filled with Vanguard funds and “other securities.” Most of the heavy lifting is done by algorithms, but the new client must speak with a financial advisor to complete the customized plan, and the fine print states that the final investment plan will be created within “a few weeks” after the consult, marking a major negative compared to the rapid onboarding at rivals. The client must agree to the new plan via another consult before implementation, which can create further delays.
 
At Wealthfront, customers can choose from ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard, Schwab, iShares and State Street, or they can save cash.
 
Vanguard’s methodology follows traditional Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) principles, emphasizing the benefits of low-cost securities, diversification, and indexing, driven by long-term financial goals. Stock and bond methodologies increase diversification by including equity funds at different capitalization and volatility levels as well as bond funds with different geographical, timing, and capital risks.
 
There are a variety of ways to efficiently invest money to avoid excessive taxes. One such way, tax-loss harvesting, is used by many robo-advisors. Tax-loss harvesting is the selling of securities at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability.
 
Wealthfront’s primary method of reducing taxes is tax-loss harvesting. It’s available for all taxable accounts. An ETF showing a loss may be swapped out for a similar ETF in order to reduce your tax bill. Accounts over $100,000 may take advantage of stock-level tax loss harvesting. 
 
Vanguard Personal Advisor Services engages in tax-loss harvesting through the MinTax cost basis method, which identifies selective units or quantities—referred to as lots—of securities to sell in any sale transaction based on specific ordering rules. The MinTax cost basis method will minimize the tax impact of transactions in many cases, but not necessarily every case. You must opt into MinTax.
 
Wealthfront is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and client accounts are protected up to a maximum of $500,000. The site actually has an article on why SIPC insurance doesn’t protect investors in the way they think it does, but the company still holds the coverage. Wealthfront also has the option to enable 2-factor authentication for further protection of your account.
 
Vanguard, on the other hand, holds client funds in the Vanguard Marketing Group, providing access to SIPC and excess insurance. Cash, however, is swept into money market funds that are not FDIC-insured. The site uses 256-bit SSL encryption and also provides two-factor authentication.
 
At Wealthfront, customers can call a support phone number if they need help with a forgotten password. You can also pose a support question to them on Twitter, and most were answered relatively quickly, although one question took more than a week to get a response. There is no online chat capability on the website or mobile apps.
