McDonald’s (MCD) is probably the biggest name in the fast-food industry. It has a lengthy history of innovation and offers quick meals that are relatively inexpensive. Thanks to extensive marketing, McDonald’s is also one of the most recognizable brands in the world.
 
As consumer tastes evolve, restaurants like McDonald's find themselves fighting to keep up with changes in demand. Other players made their way into the market by offering healthier food and different choices to fast-food consumers. In this article, we look at McDonald's and its biggest competitors in both the fast-food and fast-casual markets.
 
The first McDonald's restaurant was opened in San Bernardino, California, in 1948 by two brothers, Maurice and Richard McDonald. They sold their first hamburgers for 15 cents each. This concept of fast food, which eliminated the need for wait staff, worked out so well that it developed into a franchise system. In 1955, salesman Ray Kroc entered into a partnership with the McDonald brothers and helped build the corporation.﻿﻿
 
Kroc bought the company from Maurice and Richard McDonald in 1961.﻿﻿ The next year, the chain's popularity increased when the company introduced the famous golden arches as its logo. In 1963, the company introduced corporate mascot Ronald McDonald, and McDonald's as we know it was born.﻿﻿ Since then, the firm has expanded, with more than 38,000 locations in more than 100 countries.﻿﻿
 
McDonald's reported revenue of $21.1 billion for the full year ending 2019.﻿﻿ As of March 13, 2020, the company's market capitalization was around $132 billion, with the stock trading at about $177 per share. The average trading volume was roughly four million shares.﻿﻿
 
The burger giant continues to make changes aimed at increasing its market share. In September 2018, for example, the chain cut out artificial ingredients from its seven classic burgers.﻿﻿ However, it faces significant competition from other quick-service brands, such as Burger King, Wendy’s (WEN), Taco Bell, KFC, and Subway. Fast-casual restaurants are also close competitors, with names like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), and Panera Bread Company. Starbucks (SBUX) is a specialty quick-service brand that has some offerings that overlap with McDonald’s.
 As the food and beverage sector grows, McDonald's must face an increasing number of competitors. 
Burger King is probably the most direct competitor for McDonald's, with its staple Whopper challenging the Big Mac in the burger war. Burger King recorded over $1.65 billion in revenue for the full year ending 2018.﻿﻿
 
As of the end of 2018, Burger King had more than 17,000 locations in more than 100 countries, with roughly 11 million daily visitors worldwide.﻿﻿ Independent franchisees own nearly all of those restaurants.﻿﻿ Once a publicly-traded company, Burger King became private after it was purchased by 3G Capital in 2010 for $3.3 billion. Shareholders received $24 per share in cash. Burger King is owned by parent company Restaurant Brands International, which also owns Tim Hortons and Popeyes.﻿﻿
 
Wendy’s is a fast-food restaurant chain with more than 6,700 locations worldwide.﻿﻿ Like Burger King and MacDonald's, Wendy's focuses on burgers, fries, and other classic American food.
 
As of April 24, 2020, Wendy's had a market cap of $4.1 billion, with the stock trading around $18 per share. The average trading volume was about 6 million shares per day.﻿﻿ The company reported revenue of $1.71 billion in 2019.﻿﻿ However, total system sales were higher because sales at franchised locations are not included in consolidated revenues.
 
Yum Brands (YUM) operates several large quick-service restaurant chains, including Taco Bell, KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), and Pizza Hut.﻿﻿ The 2019 annual report notes that the company had more than 50,000 restaurants with 287 country-brand combinations; more than 98% of them were franchised.﻿﻿
 
The company's stock was trading around $78 per share and had a market cap of $23.6 billion as of March 13, 2020.﻿﻿ The company's revenue exceeded $5.6 billion for the full year in 2019.﻿﻿
 
Subway is the largest restaurant chain in the world in terms of size, with nearly 41,000 locations in nearly 100 countries.﻿﻿ All Subway locations are owned by franchisees, of which there are more than 21,000. The company’s menu consists primarily of sandwiches and salads.
 
Subway reported 2018 sales of $10.4 billion in the U.S., but its sales have been falling since 2012.﻿﻿ Since Subway is a privately-held company, it isn't traded on any stock exchange.
 
Chipotle is a fast-casual restaurant chain serving tacos, burritos, bowls, and salads. The company was formed as a small local chain which earned signifiant investment from McDonald’s before its 2006 initial public offering (IPO).﻿﻿ Chipotle operates more than 2,500 locations in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France—none of which are franchised.﻿﻿ The company has a higher price point than its fast-food competitors, and its slogan is "food with integrity."
 
Chipotle reported revenue of $ 5.59 billion in 2019.﻿﻿ As of April 24, 2020, Chipotle’s market cap was $24.4 billion, and its share price was about $880.﻿﻿
 
Starbucks is the world’s largest coffeehouse chain. As of November 2018, the company operated more than 31,000 stores in 76 countries, including more than 15,000 in the United States.﻿﻿ None of the company’s U.S. locations are franchises. Starbucks serves coffee, espresso, cappuccino, tea, pastries, sandwiches, and other foods. The chain markets itself as a high-quality option at a high price point.
 
The company reported revenue of $27 billion for 2019.﻿﻿ As of April 24, 2020, Starbucks’ share price was about $75, and the firm's market cap was $87.8 billion.﻿﻿
