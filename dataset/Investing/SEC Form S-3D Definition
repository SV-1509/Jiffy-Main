SEC Form S-3D is a filing that publicly-traded companies must submit to the SEC's EDGAR system when they purchase securities on behalf of shareholders as a result of a dividend or interest reinvestment plan.
 
A company will often propose a dividend or interest reinvestment plan as a convenient and economical way for shareholders to purchase additional shares of its common stock by using the interest and/or dividends they have earned on their existing shares of common stock.
 
Shareholders typically do not have to pay brokerage fees, commissions or service charges when a company makes a dividend or interest reinvestment. Companies may also offer shareholders the opportunity to purchase an additional amount of common shares by cash payment in addition to their dividend or interest reinvestment.
 
Requirements for filing the S-3D forms are covered under rule 462 of the Securities Act of 1933.
