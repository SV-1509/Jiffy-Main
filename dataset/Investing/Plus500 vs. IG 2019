The U.K.'s IG began life as a spread betting shop in 1974 and has grown into a financial powerhouse in recent decades, adding contracts for difference (CFD) and traditional shares to its core trading operations. IG now boasts more than 195,000 clients worldwide, with net global trading revenues of nearly $750 million and offices in 14 countries across five continents. The broker now ranks as U.K.'s top retail forex provider, according to Investment Trends.
 
Plus500 has been in the CFD business since 2008. They are registered in the UK and licensed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN 509902). The company offers CFD trading in forex, stock indices, individual equities, commodities, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, and options. Plus500 was the first broker to introduce a Bitcoin CFD (2013). The company does not charge commissions on any of its trades.
 
Both of these brokers offer CFD trading. CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. Between 74–89% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs. You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.
 
In our 2019 Best Online Brokers Awards, IG received an award for Best for Forex Trading.
 
Traders on Plus500 aren't given many options when it comes to executing their trades. They can place and monitor their trades manually on Plus500's web-based or mobile trading platform. The platform is clearly targeted to those who just need a mechanism for executing trades. Plus500 is best suited for customers who intend to perform most of their research and analysis elsewhere. Guaranteed stops are available on some markets, however, they come with an increased spread and cannot be added to previously opened trades.
 
IG gives you the flexibility to automate your trading and bypass IG and go directly to the market makers and even use your own, or a third-party, trading platform. We are impressed with the number of trading platforms and tools that are available to individual and institutional traders (asset managers and introducing brokers) alike. In fact, their only negative mark was because they require a minimum account balance of GBP 5,000 to access its Virtual Private Servers (VPS) for free (traders often use a VPS to run automated trading algorithms). Otherwise, access to the VPS costs account holders GBP 50 per month.
 
The IG mobile app includes most of the functionality available in the desktop application. Traders can access IG's trading instruments, complex order types and account details, trading signals, and charting (complete with trading indicators and drawing tools) from the Android or iPhone apps. The app has a customizable layout so that a client's default opening screen can be focused on the information they want to see first. The iPhone app includes fingerprint security but the Android version does not.
 
The Plus500 mobile applications include all of the functionality available in the desktop application as well. Between the two on mobile and emerging tech, it's a tie as neither distinguishes itself.
 
At the time of our review, Plus500 does not seem to have any dedicated research or analysis tools. Plus500 does provide customizable charts where traders can conduct a technical analysis on any of the instruments they are interested in trading. It also provides a simple "Traders' Sentiment" indicator that shows traders what percentage of Plus500 clients are buying an instrument, like the EUR/USD currency pair, and what percentage are selling the instrument.
 
IG provides comprehensive research and education through IG Analysis and Education links. IG Analysis includes well-organized news, analysis, financial calendar, market data, screener, and a look at the week ahead. A search function pulls up a deep dive of useful materials but some topic coverage is limited. Educational resources include the full-featured IG Academy, which assists in trading and knowledge development through free courses, webinars, and seminars. 
 
IG's education via its IG Academy is well organized and comprehensive. It is even available in a mobile app so you can take your education with you. The ongoing webinars and commentary incorporate the trading platform, which will help investors to become more proficient with its use. The nine trading courses available emphasize spread betting and CFDs. But the courses on technical analysis, trading psychology, understanding risk and reward, etc. are applicable regardless of the market you are trading.
