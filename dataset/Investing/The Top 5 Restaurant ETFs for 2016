The average American eats out 5.8 times a week. That translates to more than $2,600 spent per person annually. The restaurant industry continues to see the positive impact of this trend, with increased same-store sales growth and expansion. The restaurant segment is highly fragmented. Several sectors exist in the industry with quick service restaurants, fast casual, casual dining and fine dining. A shift to fast casual has put hard times in front of quick service, which remains a high revenue-driving sector with strong dividends in most cases. Fast casual still has a huge opportunity to scale across the country.
 
Investors have a lot of options when it comes to restaurant investments. Fast food giants are publicly traded, as are smaller growing brands that are taking on the fast casual market. Only one restaurant company appears in the Dow Jones Composite Average. When it comes to getting access to a basket of restaurant stocks, there is one pure play exchange-traded fund (ETF) and several others that have high percentages of holdings in the restaurant sector.
 
Investors looking for restaurant ETFs should begin with the Restaurant ETF, a new offering from the ETF Managers Group. The fund offers exposure to quick service restaurants, fast casual, casual dining and fine dining. The fund also covers restaurants of every size, with major players and up-and-coming brands currently moving beyond regional expansion.
 
The Restaurant ETF went public in October, investing in stocks with market capitalizations greater than $200 million and more than $1 million in annual turnover. In a bit of a twist, the fund is also equally weighted, giving equal exposure to all restaurants included. This gives investors a great opportunity to profit from all of the different sizes of restaurants and the different subsectors.
 
Top holdings in November 2015 included Chuy's Holdings, McDonald's and Starbucks. It also includes small growing restaurant brands, such as Kona Grill, Del Frisco's Restaurant Group and El Pollo Loco among its holdings. Newer public companies such as Noodles & Company, Zoes Kitchen, The Habit Burger, Shake Shack and Del Taco are also among the 50 restaurants represented by the fund.
 
As of November, the ETF had $2.5 million in assets under management (AUM). The fund rebalances semi-annually in June and December. The fund does have one of the pricier expense ratios at 0.75%, but it is the only pure play ETF on restaurants.

The investment in smaller restaurant stocks allows for gains from national expansion and scalability.
