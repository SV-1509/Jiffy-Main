If you follow the NFL, then you know a lot about the team that takes the top spot as the most valuable franchise in the league. The Dallas Cowboys are the most valuable team in the NFL as of 2019, based on Forbes valuations. The Cowboys have had the most valuable franchise for 13 straight years, with a value of $5.5 billion, up 10% from 2018.﻿﻿
 
The NFL remains the most valuable sports league in the world. The average NFL team makes more than any other sports team. The league earned $14.48 billion in 2018,﻿﻿ coming in at an average of $452 million per team, while they also prove to be the most profitable—generating $102 million per team in operating income on average. The NFL keeps a tight rein on who can and can’t own a team, with strict guidelines and vetting process. As well, the rules for using debt when purchasing a franchise are stringent and no corporate ownership is allowed in the NFL.﻿﻿
 
Overall, the average value of NFL teams—$2.86 billion—increased 11% year-over-year for 2019. This mean value has increased every year since 2011.﻿﻿ The Carolina Panthers franchise was purchased by billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper in 2018 for a record $2.3 billion.﻿﻿ This handily beat what Terry and Kim Pegula paid for the Buffalo Bills—$1.4 billion—in 2014.﻿﻿
 
Below are the top 10 most valuable teams as of 2019.
