On the surface, Betterment and Fidelity Go share many similarities. Both firms ask you a few questions when you first sign up to determine how many years you’ll be contributing to your account and your attitude towards risk. Both robo-advisors let you open accounts without funding. The portfolios designed by both robo-advisors are made up of low-cost funds and follow Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) principles for diversity and risk, and you are encouraged to ride out market turbulence by holding your assets no matter what. However, there are some key differences between Betterment and Fidelity Go that will help you choose the best fit for your money.
 
Betterment has very easy-to-follow steps for setting goals, and each one can be monitored separately. You can set up a variety of goals with different target dates, and the portfolios will vary considerably. Your asset allocation is displayed in a ring with equities in shades of green and fixed income in shades of blue. If you’re falling behind on meeting a goal you’ve set, you’re encouraged to put more aside.
 
You can only track a single goal per account using Fidelity Go, but you can open multiple accounts if you want to dedicate funds to separate goals. Once the account has been funded and invested, you can choose a dollar amount you're trying to reach along with your target date. Fidelity then estimates the likelihood of reaching your dollar goal by your target date, based on your initial deposit and planned monthly additions. If it looks like you may not reach your goal, Fidelity offers some suggestions of things you can do that could improve your likelihood of success. If you have other Fidelity accounts, you can see how they are all doing on a single screen. Selecting the Fidelity Go account from the list brings up an asset allocation graph and a performance summary.
 
Both Fidelity Go and Betterment offer retirement accounts.
 
Betterment prompts you to connect external accounts, such as bank and brokerage holdings, to your account to provide a clearer picture of your overall retirement savings.
 
Fidelity Go doesn’t offer this level of account syncing, but you’ll be shown the likelihood of reaching your retirement goal in IRA accounts. While both platforms do a good job of keeping you on track, Betterment has the advantage of knowing more about your overall finances than Fidelity Go does - provided you do sync up your accounts.
 
Fidelity Go and Betterment both offer the most commonly used accounts, taxable and retirement, but Betterment offers a wider range overall. This is a key difference if, for example, you intend to use a simplified employee pension (SEP) IRA. However, average investors will find the account options they expect at either robo-advisor.

Fidelity account types:
 
Betterment has a wider range of features than Fidelity Go, as the latter is more narrowly focused on investment rather than all your finances. Betterment’s savings and checking accounts are signs that the robo-advisor is moving towards a complete, digital-only solution to manage all aspects of your financial life.
 
When it comes to fees, the comparison between Betterment and Fidelity Go requires a bit of digging.
 
Betterment has two plans available: a Digital plan, which assesses an annual fee of 0.25% with a $0 minimum balance, and a Premium plan, with a 0.40% annual fee and a $100,000 minimum balance. The Digital plan includes personalized advice, automatic rebalancing, and tax-saving strategies, while the Premium plan also offers advice on assets held outside Betterment, and guidance on life events like getting married, having a child or retiring. More importantly, the ETFs within the Betterment portfolios have management fees ranging from 0.07%-0.15%.
 
Fidelity Go's management fee is 0.35% of assets under management for portfolios of $50,000 or over.. There is no fee for accounts holding less than $10,000. For accounts between $10,000 -$49,999, Fidelity Go charges a subscription fee of $3 per month. The portfolios hold proprietary Fidelity no-fee mutual funds so there are really no additional fees. Many lower-fee robo-advisories, including Betterment, actually end up being more expensive than Fidelity Go when the average expense ratios of the underlying funds are added into the mix. Although Fidelity Go has a higher headline fee, the two are essentially even in this regard.
 
Neither Betterment nor Fidelity Go requires a minimum deposit to open an account. Fidelity Go notes that it takes $10 to get started investing, so the cash sits in a short-term investment with no advisory fee charged until that threshold is met. The threshold appears to be identical with Betterment according to the ADV 2A, but it is not stated explicitly in any of the marketing materials.  
 
Betterment offers five portfolio types based upon classic Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) principles and/or specific investment themes:
 
Betterment accounts are rebalanced dynamically when they deviate from their intended goal allocations. Portfolios get more conservative as the target date approaches, with the goal of locking in gains and avoiding major losses.
 
Fidelity Go's portfolios are invested in proprietary no-fee funds managed by Fidelity itself. In our robo-advisor ranking, this proprietary approach hurt Fidelity Go compared to other platforms even though the funds themselves have performed well. Approximately 0.5% of the portfolio is held in cash. Portfolio rebalancing is done semi-annually, but it will also occur when cash in the account hits an internal limit (around 1%) or the portfolio drifts significantly from the target allocation.
 
Betterment offers tax-loss harvesting to all taxable accounts. Fidelity Go does not have tax-loss harvesting as it only offers its proprietary ETFs, setting a practical limit on how many substitutions can be done for tax purposes.
 
Both Betterment and Fidelity have solid security features around their web platforms and mobile apps, including two-factor authentication and biometric logins.
 
Betterment doesn’t directly carry Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance, but trades are cleared through Apex Clearing, which has risk management tools in place. Fidelity has a Customer Protection Guarantee, which reimburses you for losses from unauthorized activity in your accounts. Fidelity also participates in asset protection programs such as FDIC and SIPC to insure against losses should the firm have an unexpected financial catastrophe. Overall, both Betterment and Fidelity have sufficient controls in place to protect your data and your money.
 
Betterment offers customer service via phone and email 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time, Monday-Friday, You can get help from financial planners at any time with a Premium account, but you’ll pay a fee of $199-299 to consult a planner if you have a basic account.
