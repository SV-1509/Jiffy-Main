Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a type of traded security that generally invests in the ownership or financing of income-producing real estate. Within the REIT industry, one of the more popular investment choices is in healthcare-related real estate. Health care REITs invest in properties such as hospitals, medical office buildings and senior housing. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a commonly-used tool with which to invest, which is what many investors did when they purchased the three top ETFs below. All information updated May 15, 2020.
