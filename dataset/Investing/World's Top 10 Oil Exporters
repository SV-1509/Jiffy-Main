The number one exported product in the world is oil. In 2018, the commodity accounted for 5.9% of the global value of all exported products. That year, crude oil shipments in aggregate were worth $1.113 trillion, according to the latest available data.
 
Briefly, in June, the U.S. eclipsed Saudi Arabia in monthly oil exports (as a result of a spike in shale production) before ceding the top spot to the longtime leader. Currently, the U.S. places third after Saudi Arabia and Russia, in terms of annual oil exports by country. However, the U.S. is expected to take over the runner-up spot from Russia, placing second in a list of all exporters on an annual basis by 2024, according to forecasts from the International Energy Agency.
 
Below is a list of the top 10 oil-exporting countries based on data for all of 2018. These countries account for two-thirds of total global oil exports.

Formed in 1932, the country was responsible for 16.1% of global oil exports in 2018, totaling $182.5 billion in value. The country is located on the Arab peninsula and is comparable in size to Alaska.
 
The massive, transcontinental country of Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter. In 2018, Russia's oil exports accounted for 11.4% of global oil exports, exceeding a value of $129 billion. As a size comparison, Russia is twice as large as the entire United States.

The northernmost nation in North America, Canada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of oil. In 2018, the country exported $66.9 billion worth of the commodity, or 5.9%. Due to the size of the Athabasca oil sands, it is estimated that Canada has more than 10% of the world's oil reserves.
