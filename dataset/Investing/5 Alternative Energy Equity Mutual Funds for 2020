As activists push for alternative energy to become more ubiquitous, companies in the energy sector are also seeing demand for green products, from solar panels to wind turbines. This may lead to higher earnings and a rebound in some alternative energy companies' market values, which have been underperformers over the past few years.
 
Alternative energy equity mutual funds provide investors with professionally managed exposure to many companies involved in various clean energy-related business activities such as solar, hydrogen, wind, geothermal and hydroelectric. Investors who want to gear up for the potential rise in alternative energy stocks should consider these mutual funds. All data are as of January 13, 2020.
