Dividends are corporate earnings that companies pass on to their shareholders. They can be in the form of cash payments, shares of stock, or other property. Dividends may be issued over various timeframes and payout rates.
 
There are a number of reasons why a corporation may choose to pass some of its earnings on as dividends, and several other reasons why it might prefer to reinvest all of its earnings back into the company.
 
For a mature company with stable earnings that doesn't need to reinvest as much in itself, here's why issuing dividends can be a good idea:
 
Companies that pay dividends include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Verizon (VZ).﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
 One of the simplest ways for companies to foster goodwill among their shareholders, drive demand for the stock, and communicate financial well-being and shareholder value is through paying dividends.

Quickly expanding companies typically will not make dividend payments because during pivotal growth stages, it's fiscally shrewder to re-invest the cashback into operations.

The choice not to pay dividends may be more beneficial to investors from a tax perspective:
 
Companies often reinvest earnings in lieu of making dividend payments, in order to avoid the potentially high costs associated with issuing new stock.

When a company pays dividends, it returns some of its profits directly to shareholders, sending a signal to the market of stable and reliable operations. Newer companies, or those in the technology space, often opt instead to re-direct profits back into the company for growth and expansion, so they do not pay dividends. Rather, this reinvestment of retained earnings is often reflected in a rising share price and capital gains for investors.
