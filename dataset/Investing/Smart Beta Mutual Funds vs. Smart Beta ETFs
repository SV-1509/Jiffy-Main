Smart beta mutual funds and ETFs attempt to capture enhanced returns with reduced risk via diversification. This isn’t your traditional form of diversification. Instead of being weighted by size or other traditional passive index factors, most smart beta funds are weighted on specific characteristics, such as value, growth, dividend growth, momentum, low volatility or high quality. Smart beta index fund managers seek to replicate these focused indexes which use customized screening methodologies to filter stocks. Turnover is generally low as the indexes typically rebalance semi-annually or annually cutting expense ratios. Across the industry these funds are a factor in the ongoing debate of active versus passive as they offer many advantages of customized stock picking with lower expenses.
 
One of the big differences in smart beta mutual funds versus ETFs is that very few mutual funds exist for retail investment. Most of the smart beta mutual funds in the market are structured for investment by institutional investors and fall more in the enhanced, active smart beta category. As such the majority of innovation around smart beta has been channeled toward ETF structures. Below we take a look at a few examples.
 
PIMCO RAE Fundamental PLUS (PXTIX) and DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE I (DSEEX) are two popular smart beta mutual funds.

Investments in smart beta by Blackrock and Vanguard are also showing the worthiness of the strategy’s attention.
