Jana Partners is an activist hedge fund founded by Barry Rosenstein in 2001. The fund specializes in event-driven investing by applying a fundamental analysis to identify undervalued companies in the market. The firm also engages in activist investing that can potentially serve as an event-driven, fundamental investing catalyst. Jana Partners is based in New York. The fund manages around $5.35 billion with $3.78 billion in 13F equity holdings as of June 30, 2018.
 
Rosenstein graduated from Lehigh University and received his master’s of business administration from Wharton. He started his career at Merrill Lynch. Rosenstein worked with Asher Edelman, a prominent corporate raider during the 1980s. The character of Gordon Gekko in the film "Wall Street" was modeled, in part, on Edelman. Rosenstein left New York for San Francisco in the early 1990s. While in San Francisco, he had initial success with the funding of Copart, Inc., the largest auto salvage company in the world. Rosenstein then ran a private equity firm, Sagaponack Partners, but he found the private equity structure to be too limited. Rosenstein began Jana Partners in 2001 with around $17 million in backing from Leon Cooperman, a prominent hedge fund manager. Rosenstein is now one of a group of elite activist investors that includes Carl Icahn, Daniel Loeb and Bill Ackman. Rosenstein’s investment management team at Jana Partners includes David DiDomenico, Scott Ostfeld, Charles Penner, Sam Assamongkol, Kevin Galligan and Daniel Hanson. As of June 30, 2018, the firm had a quarterly portfolio return of 7.49% and a 12-month return of 11.2%. These returns have matched the S&P 500 with a second-quarter return of 5.3% and a 12-month return through June 30, 2018, of 11.9%
