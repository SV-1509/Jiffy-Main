Online brokers and robo-advisors let you open a variety of accounts, but for people taking advantage of the tax benefits of an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), a few other features come in handy. 
 
The best IRA accounts are either traditional stock brokers or robo-advisors that have excellent retirement planning tools and reporting. We looked for help determining how much to save for retirement as well as clear reports. We also made sure these brokers/advisors do not apply an annual fee for managing your IRA, so you can keep that money growing for your retirement.

Wealthfront’s use of third-party data makes it incredibly useful for all sorts of planning—not just retirement—and you may find yourself running scenarios far beyond your long-term investment needs. You can even figure out how long you can take a sabbatical from work and travel, while still making your other goals work.﻿﻿

M1 Finance offers a unique combination of automated investing with a high level of customization, allowing clients to create a portfolio tailored to their exact specifications. You can create an IRA portfolio containing low-cost ETFs or use individual stocks—or both. M1’s target customer has a long-term focus and experience with using a traditional online brokerage to invest in stocks and ETFs. M1 is offering these potential clients a lower-cost alternative that allows fractional share transactions and a good amount of control over the portfolio contents. This is the key difference between M1 and many other offerings, as you often are giving up much of the control in exchange for the portfolio management services.﻿﻿
 
With M1, you can choose one of more than 80 expert portfolios or build your own. You can also build pies—M1’s name for the circular charts showing asset mixes in a portfolio—made out of other pies and keep them all balanced to your specifications. Overall, M1 is offering a remarkably flexible platform that includes stock and ETF screeners to help with investment selection. This type of tool and the approach behind it are still rare in the robo-advisory world.﻿﻿
 
M1 doesn’t brand itself as an advisory service; rather, it is an automated investing platform designed to take care of the ongoing management of the portfolio you create. This is a do-it-yourself investing platform, and it expects you to know what you are doing, and why. As such, M1 doesn’t have many tools for setting goals beyond several dozen articles about retirement savings.﻿﻿ This may be jarring to investors expecting more hand-holding, but intermediate investors may welcome the lack of distractions standing in the way of actual portfolio creation. Its offerings have resonated with many investors, though—in February 2020, M1 announced that it had crossed the $1 billion threshold of assets under management.﻿﻿
 M1 allows you to trade fractional shares so you are fully invested. M1 charges zero trading fees or asset management fees. There are a variety of ways to go about portfolio building, including more than 80 "expert" portfolios you can follow for the purpose of mimicking. The way M1 places trades puts transaction timing out of your control. This will be an issue if you are taking a trading approach to your IRA. Accounts with less than $20 and no trading activity for 90 days are charged a fee. M1 does not employ financial advisors and offers very little help for setting financial goals. You also cannot consolidate external accounts for planning purposes. 
There are several ways to use Betterment: you can sync all of your financial accounts to get an overall picture of your assets without investing, you can invest in one of their portfolios, or you can create a Flexible Portfolio with some of your own specifications. Portfolios are rebalanced when necessary rather than on a set schedule.﻿﻿ Betterment is very much a goal-based platform, and there are many planning tools available to users along with plenty of advice. You can attach a specific investing goal to each portfolio, which can be invested in different strategies. Funds for longer-term goals like saving for retirement can be allocated to one of the higher-risk portfolios, while shorter-term goals, such as funding a down payment on a house, can be allocated to the lower-risk ones. 
 
Betterment has very easy-to-follow steps for setting a goal, and each one can be monitored separately. The asset allocation is displayed in a ring, with equities in shades of orange and fixed income in shades of blue.﻿﻿ If you’re falling behind on meeting your retirement goals, for example, Betterment will encourage you to put more aside. This can be a helpful prompt, particularly for young investors who may not yet feel the urgency to save for retirement.
 Betterment’s IRA account set up is quick and easy, and portfolios are fully transparent prior to funding. You can sync external retirement accounts to your Betterment retirement goal to view your overall progress with ease. Betterment makes it easy to change portfolio risk or switch to a different type of portfolio. Users of the planning function are constantly nudged to fund a Betterment account. The standard plan incurs a charge of $199–$299 to talk to a financial planner. Investopedia is dedicated to providing investors with unbiased, comprehensive reviews and ratings of online brokers. Our reviews are the result of six months of evaluating all aspects of an online broker’s platform, including the user experience, the quality of trade executions, the products available on their platforms, costs and fees, security, the mobile experience and customer service. We established a rating scale based on our criteria, collecting over 3,000 data points that we weighed into our star scoring system. In addition, every broker we surveyed was required to fill out a 320-point survey about all aspects of their platform that we used in our testing. Many of the online brokers we evaluated provided us with in-person demonstrations of their platforms at our offices. Our team of industry experts, led by Theresa W. Carey, conducted our reviews and developed this best-in-industry methodology for ranking online investing platforms for users at all levels. Click here to read our full methodology. Fidelity.
