The IOSCO is made up of several committees that meet at conferences that take place around the world several times a year. Its administrative offices of the General Secretariat are based in Madrid. It has four regional committees and a technical committee, which does much of the organizationâ€™s regulatory work.
 
In 1983, the Inter-American Regional Association, which had been formed in 1974, expanded its operations into a global cooperative that became the IOSCO. The first regulators from outside the Americas to join the IOSCO were from Indonesia, France, Korea, and the United Kingdom. The first IOSCO Annual Conference to take place outside the Americas was the July 1986 Paris Annual Conference.
 
The IOSCO currently operates in more than 100 jurisdictions, covering more than 90% of the world's markets, and is considered to be the source for global standards of market operation. In 1998, it approved the IOSCO Principles, which set the benchmark for securities markets worldwide. The IOSCO has since released a methodology for how to achieve those benchmarks. The IOSCO's work has been praised at the highest levels of government, especially in the aftermath of 9/11, as transactions between different countries became something that required increased scrutiny and regulatory control.
