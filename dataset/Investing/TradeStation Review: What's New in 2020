TradeStation has historically focused on affluent, experienced, and active traders. The company's goal going forward is to broaden its appeal and reach with pricing changes and new services. TradeStation had a busy 2019, acquiring and relaunching a firm dedicated to education and community called YouCanTrade as well as launching a cryptocurrency brokerage called TradeStation Crypto Inc. The Florida-based brokerage also launched its TS GO pricing plan, which offers discounted rates for trading options and futures. We'll look at how these changes have affected TradeStation's ranking in a more competitive online brokerage industry, and whether they are enough to make TradeStation the right choice for your investment needs.
 
TradeStation's commitment to superior customer service and its focus on high-quality market data and trade executions makes them a good choice for the active trader or an intermediate level trader who wants to improve their skills. Its systems are stable and remain available during surges in trading volume. Overall, TradeStation has put a great deal of effort into making themselves more attractive to the mainstream investor, but the platform is more geared toward the active, technically-minded trader.
 Stable platform that has very little downtime Excellent charting and technical analysis tools Portfolio Maestro analyzes performance in a variety of ways Steep learning curve to be navigated to develop your own trading system Multiple pricing choices that can be confusing Fixed income transactions must be made with a broker 
TradeStation's usability has been improving over time. During 2019, TradeStation refreshed its account opening process and streamlined it as much as is legally possible—six steps—with your progress clearly illustrated. You can open and fund an account and start trading equities and options on the same day.
 
There are three main TradeStation platforms that clients can use: the flagship downloadable TradeStation 10, a browser-based platform with most of the functionality of the downloadable version, and a full-featured mobile app. Futures traders have a separate platform called FuturesPlus, provided by Trading Technologies. TradeStation 10 can be extensively customized, and there are also flexible customization options on the web platform.
 
There are approximately 85 third-party applications that can connect to TradeStation's trading engine via API, including TradingView, Yahoo Finance, and VectorVest. If you have a favorite analytical platform, you can easily check to see that it can be linked to TradeStation.
 
All asset classes that a client is eligible to trade can also be accessed on the mobile app. Watchlists are integrated between the web and mobile apps, but watchlists developed on TradeStation 10 are stored on your local device. 
 
The first screen you'll see after logging into either the downloadable platform or the web platform is TradeStation Today, which includes featured videos, links to workspaces, the broker's Twitter feed, and an economic calendar. The web platform has most of the downloadable platform's toolset, but it is a little easier to use due to its tabbed layout simplifying some of the menu-based navigation. All data streams in real-time across TradeStation. You can place, modify, and cancel trades from charts or by using keyboard shortcuts. TradeStation's trade ticket is called Matrix, and it adapts to the asset class you're trading. Hovering your mouse over a bid or ask price opens a trade ticket, which you can then modify prior to sending the order. 
 
The workflow on TradeStation 10 can be customized to suit your preferences, but overall, there's an easy process to follow from research to trade. Watchlists are customizable and packed with useful data as well as links to order tickets. All platforms allow conditional orders and bracket orders, while the desktop platform offers additional advanced order types, including trading algorithms that seek out liquidity for equities and options. TradeStation offers connectivity to about 40 equities, options, and futures market centers, though some data requires an additional subscription fee.
 
Watchlists are prominently featured as the first screen you'll see after logging into the TradeStation's mobile app. Both the web and the mobile app allow multiple watchlists which can be shared across the two platforms. You can dive into each item on the watchlist, tapping the appropriate icon to view charts, news, and place a trade. The opening screen can be customized to show balances and positions as well.
 
Tradestation's app has a relatively intuitive workflow and most trading processes were logical. Trading options is quite easy on the mobile app; reversing or rolling an options strategy can be done with a couple of taps.
 
There is a separate TradeStation Crypto app for that asset class, which allows users to place trades as well as check on their balances.
 
TradeStation offers a large range of assets, including some less traditional ones like cryptocurrencies. TradeStation offers equity, options, futures, and futures options trading online. Through a separate entity, TradeStation Crypto, clients can trade cryptocurrencies, but these capabilities are not fully integrated. TradeStation Crypto links to the ErisX cryptocurrency spot market. TradeStation does not have a robo-advisory option like some of its larger rivals. The broker also lacks forex trading and fractional share trading. Beyond that, however, investors can trade the following:
 
All TradeStation platforms allow conditional orders and bracket orders, while the TradeStation 10 platform offers additional advanced order types and algorithms. Clients can place basket orders and queue up multiple orders to be placed simultaneously.
 
You can change the default tax lot relief method assigned to your account for each asset type traded (stocks, options, etc.) through the Gain/Loss Tax Management feature within the Client Center in advance of the trade. After a trade is placed, but prior to settlement, you can adjust the tax method through the Gain/Loss Tax Management feature. Other adjustments require that you speak to a live broker.
 
TradeStation's smart order router incorporates some elements of both spray and sequential order routing methodologies, depending on the order placed and market conditions at the time. These methodologies are fundamentally based on an assumption that what is displayed in the market depth (price and size) is what is actually available, though there is much more liquidity thanks to hidden orders and dark pools, and therefore, there is opportunity for price improvement and better execution quality. Based on this, TradeStation employs logic intended to seek out and capture as much price improvement and hidden size as reasonably possible within a reasonable period of time.
 
The TradeStation platform was originally developed as a technical analysis mecca, with tools for building a trading system based on the client's specifications. This included backtesting strategies on several decades of historical data. Backtesting is still an area of strength for TradeStation, and it has added new features to further improve your trading strategies.
 
TradeStation, with its history of catering to very frequent traders, has quite a few pricing plans from which to choose. The most recent plans offer some free trades, while the legacy plans offer discounts to extremely frequent traders. During the price-cutting flurry of fall 2019, Tradestation introduced two new pricing plans that both feature commission-free equity trades and options transactions with no per-leg fee. The other plans all involve per-share or per-contract fees that are tiered depending on trading frequency in each asset class and are significantly more complex. You can find the full details on TradeStation's pricing page.﻿﻿ We'll look at the costs in the new pricing plans.
 
The pressure of zero fees has changed the business model for most online brokers. In lieu of fees, the way brokers make money from you is less obvious—as are some of the subtle ways they make money for you.
 
Given TradeStation's legacy as a technical analysis platform, it offers some excellent research capabilities. Most of the tools emphasize technical triggers using charting functions.
 
RadarScreen and Hot Lists allow very specific screening capabilities. You can screen on technical or fundamental data. There are dozens of screeners already programmed into the TradeStation 10 platform, or you can customize your own. RadarScreen lets you build a list of up to 2,000 stocks that you can continuously monitor in real-time, based on more than 180 technical and fundamental criteria. It's one of the best stock and ETF screeners offered by any online brokerage.
 
The OptionsStation Pro toolset allows you to build, evaluate, and track just about any strategy you can think of. It includes visual representations of options chains that let you see your strategy's break-even probability across a series of expiration dates. You can use Hot Lists to find options opportunities as well.
 
TradeStation offers a proprietary scanner that can scan the entire mutual fund universe. This isn't a fund-focused broker, though, so the scanner could best be described as rudimentary—especially in comparison to the stock, ETF, and options screeners.
 
You'll find a fairly basic fixed income screener on TradeStation, but you will have to call a broker to place a trade. Investors who are primarily focused on fixed income and require more detailed screening criteria should look elsewhere.
 
TradeStation doesn't offer the typical calculators, such as those devoted to retirement planning, that you might find on other sites. Its tools are all geared to active traders, such as time and sales, market depth, and snapshots that show how your positions are performing.
 
Hot Lists are available on all platforms, including mobile. TradeStation's RadarScreen offers endless sorting and screening possibilities. You can open a hotlist inside RadarScreen to further filter and screen. The Trader Concierge feature generates trading idea alerts.
 
The TradeStation 10 platform has a News tab on the right-hand side of the screen that can be set up to show a headline only or a headline and an accompanying graphic. You can symbol link positions and watchlists to stream news or filter the news by a topic such as energy or cannabis. The general market news displays on the TradeStation Today page. TradeStation's in-house market commentary, called TradeStation Market Insights, is available on the desktop platform and is updated five to ten times during the trading day.
 
There is limited third-party research built into the TradeStation platforms, but you can subscribe to tools and research through the Trading App Store. Most of these add-ons incur some additional cost, however. There are also no analyst reports available.
 
TradeStation offers top-end charting capabilities on all of its platforms. TradeStation 10 offers incredible charting capability based on tick data. Automated technical analysis is built into the charting package, displaying technical patterns on the charts as they form. The web charting has been greatly enhanced and includes all streaming real-time data with the ability to add overlays and all kinds of indicators. Web charting capabilities more closely match TradeStation 10, including a new toolbar with access to adjust timeframes, drawing tools, sessions, and styles. Web charting also features background dragging and on-chart controls to zoom in/out, scroll left/right, move to the most recent bar and reset the chart range. You can trade directly from a chart, including previewing a closing bracket order on a chart. The order ticket can be modified by dragging and dropping closing price targets onto the chart. This is one of the best charting applications available from any broker, and it is especially notable for how well it is integrated with TradeStation's order management system.
 
The Portfolio Maestro includes analytics, optimization, and performance reporting to give traders a realistic perspective of their portfolio. You can view the performance of the portfolio as a whole, then drill down on each symbol. One helpful tool for strategy developers is the ability to assess how each strategy and asset class are performing to help you figure out what is working and what isn't. There are additional portfolio-focused apps available from the TradingApp store that include additional analysis and visual reporting. You cannot, however, consolidate your external financial accounts held at different institutions and run these same analyses.
 
All balance, position, and margin data is presented in real-time. The Gain/Loss Tax Management feature calculates cost basis for your closed positions, but you can't run an analysis on a potential trade.
 
You can use the charting features to create a trading journal. A visual representation of each trade can appear on a chart of the financial instrument (stock future, etc.) being traded, and customers can add notes to those charts.
 
TradeStation says it does not directly provide education services anymore now that it has acquired YouCanTrade.com. It's Learn page directs you to investment and trading educational presentations and materials on YouCanTrade's website.﻿﻿ Courses that focus on how to use the TradeStation platforms are offered free of charge as are two channels that launched in June 2020: "Crypto Untapped" is dedicated to cryptocurrency trading and "Traddictiv" is led by a team of trading coaches. In addition, "The Trend" is a daily show that goes over current market events and trading ideas. Other topics require a subscription.
 
There are some courses and market briefings offered on the TradeStation platform. TradeStation's Knowledge Center appears to be undergoing a remodel. The articles are not as easy to find as they were a few months ago. TradeStation's frequently-asked questions page leads with TSbot, which is the TradeStation chatbot. As mentioned, TSbot is not yet very helpful, frequently answering, "Oops, I may not have been trained on that yet. Can you please rephrase and try once again?"﻿﻿
 
One incredibly valuable tool for traders looking to learn is TradeStation's trading simulator, which has all the tools you'll find on TradeStation 10. This includes the large historical database for backtesting strategies, though the simulator itself uses delayed data.﻿﻿
 
TradeStation security is up to industry standards:
 
TradeStation has put a great deal of effort into making themselves more attractive to the mainstream investor, but the platform is still best suited for the active, technically-minded trader. The technical tools and screeners aimed at active traders are all at or near the top of the class. One thing we'd like to see is the futures and cryptocurrency trading platforms integrated into the equity/options platforms to provide a single interface experience. Despite this minor annoyance, the focus on technical research and quality trade executions make TradeStation a great choice for active traders. Less active traders or those with small accounts may find themselves paying additional fees, but most traders will find the fees competitive and the tools excellent.
 
In contrast, the tools aimed at regular investors, including the mutual fund and fixed income screeners, are a noticeable step down. TradeStation is clearly taking steps towards being more friendly to retail investors, but it has a long way to go in this regard. This isn't the place for an investor who wants to "set it and forget it" or needs educational resources to get started. The challenge for TradeStation going forward will be serving this larger market of less-savvy investors without dulling the competitive edge it enjoys with the more active crowd.
