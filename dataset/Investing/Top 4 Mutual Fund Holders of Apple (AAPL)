Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the largest technology companies in the world and the first U.S. company to reach a market valuation of $1 trillion. As of Feb. 22, 2020, the company's market capitalization had grown to $1.37 trillion.
 
Here are the four largest mutual funds betting on Apple, Inc.
 
The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is known on Wall Street as a one-stop shop for a wide range of small- and large-cap stocks. The fund seeks to capture returns on the entire stock market and therefore holds more than 3,680 stocks. While the composition of VTSMX is not much different from that of S&P 500 ETFs, its investments in many small-cap stocks has kept it above others for several years. 
 
About 20.1% of the fund's assets are invested in technology stocks, with Microsoft edging out Apple for the top position as of the end of January 2020. The fund owns more than 114.6 million shares of Apple, amounting to 2.62% of the company's outstanding stock as of its latest filing in June 2019.
 
The fund's expense ratio is 0.14%, just a few points below the category average. The fund's three-year annualized return is 14.43%.
 
Another fund tracking the S&P 500, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund gives weights to the stocks it invests in based on their positions in the S&P list. With net assets of $459.3 billion as of June 2019, the fund's asset allocation skews in favor of information technology and financials, forming 21% and 13.3% of its portfolio, respectively. The company holds about 86 million shares of Apple, just under 2% of the company, making it the second-largest mutual fund investor in Apple.
 All of these funds have comparatively low expense ratios. 
The expense ratio for VFINX is 0.14%. The fund has a three-year annualized return of 15.12 as of the end of 2019.
 
The Standard and Poor's depository receipts, also known as a SPDR or "spider," was put into the market in 1993 by State Street Global Advisors. The ETF's main function is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500. Each share of SPY owns a small portion in all 500 stocks in the S&P 500. SPY is bought and sold much like a stock, but instead of making a bet on one particular company you're making a bet on the market as a whole. SPY is invested heavily in technology, with 24.63% of its holdings dedicated to the sector. The fund holds 46.2 million shares, about 1.06%, of all Apple stock as of October 2019, making it the company's third-largest mutual fund holder. Apple shares account for 4.79% of the fund's $337 billion portfolio.
 
The expense ratio for SPY is 0.09%, well below category average for other funds.
 
This large-blend Vanguard Group fund, launched in 1990, seeks capital appreciation and dividend income by investing in all 500 stocks that make up the S&P 500 benchmark index. VINIX remains fully invested in equities at all times. The top market sector represented in the underlying index and in the fund’s holdings is information technology at about 24%, with financials and heathcare also heavily represented. With about 41 million shares of Apple as of June 2019, the fund weighs in as the company's fourth-largest mutual fund holder. VINIX's bet on Apple accounts for 4.20% of the fund's $240 billion portfolio.
 
The fund’s expense ratio is very low, at 0.03%. The three-year annualized return is 15.24% as of the end of 2019.
