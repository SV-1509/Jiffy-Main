With a trading volume of over $5 trillion per day, the foreign exchange market, also called forex or FX, is the world's largest market. The size and deep liquidity of the forex market, along with 24-hour trading, five days a week, make it an appealing choice for traders.
 
The following 10 financial conduct authority (FCA)-regulated forex brokers, listed in no particular order, are chosen based on factors including financial stability, execution quality, and trading platforms available. When choosing among them, one might consider preferences such as markets available, execution software, and the competitiveness of spreads.
 The most popular and highly rated brokerages licensed in the UK are not physically based there. 
Among the leading FCA-regulated forex brokers in the UK, the majority are actually based abroad. In many cases, this means that they are also regulated by other bodies, such as the National Futures Association (NFA) in the United States. While the retail forex industry continues to develop and improve, traders must remain vigilant in scrutinizing where they place their funds for investment.
