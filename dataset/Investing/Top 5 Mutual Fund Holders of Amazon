Founded in 1994 as an online bookstore, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) has become the largest Internet-based retailer in the world. The company has also branched out into cloud computing, electronics, and content distribution, and it has begun testing drone delivery in certain areas.
 
Amazon's stock has become notable for its extreme overvaluation according to traditional valuation metrics. One of the main reasons for Amazon's lack of profitability is its continued dedication to expansion by reinvesting much of its earnings and cash flow back into the business. This high-growth strategy has made its stock popular among both individuals and mutual funds that employ a higher-risk investing approach. 
 
Here are the top five mutual fund holders of Amazon who collectively own around 7% of the company, as of March 4, 2020.
