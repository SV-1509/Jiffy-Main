It is a variation of the traditional method that treats all qualifying bids in an impartial manner. This provides individual investors with equal access to bid on the price of the stock. Today, Morningstar is listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MORN. As of January 2018, shares were trading below $100 with a market capitalization slightly above $4 billion. 
 
In 1984, Joe Mansueto left his job as a stock analyst when he realized investors lacked the necessary information to make intelligent investment decisions. At the same time, the mutual fund industry started to accelerate as retirement plans shifted from defined benefit like company pensions to defined contribution. These changing dynamics informed the foundation of Morningstar. Over the next 30 years, Morningstar continued to add products and services that help investors of various expertise. Today, Joe Mansueto is no longer the CEO of Morningstar but still holds the position of executive chairman.
