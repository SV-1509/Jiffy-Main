Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is an important number. First of all, it determines whether you can contribute to a Roth IRA and if you can deduct IRA contributions.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ It also factors into your eligibility for certain education tax benefits and income tax credits.﻿﻿ Furthermore, it establishes your eligibility for income-based Medicaid and subsidized health insurance plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace.﻿﻿
 
Still, as important as this number is, you won’t find it on your tax return.﻿﻿ You’ll have to crunch some numbers to find your MAGI.
 
MAGI can be defined as your household’s adjusted gross income with any tax-exempt interest income and certain deductions added back.﻿﻿ The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses MAGI to establish if you qualify for certain tax benefits. Most notably, MAGI determines:
 
For example, you can contribute to a traditional IRA no matter how much money you earn.﻿﻿ However, you can’t deduct those contributions when you file your tax return if your MAGI exceeds limits set by the IRS and you and/or your spouse have a retirement plan at work.﻿﻿
 
Determining your MAGI is a three-step process:
 
Your gross income includes everything you earned during the year from:
 
Note: There are two scenarios in which alimony payments are not considered gross income. The first is if your divorce agreement was executed after 2018. The second is if your divorce agreement was executed before 2019 but later modified to expressly state that such payments are not deductible for the payer.﻿﻿
 Your gross income appears on line 7b of Form 1040. ﻿﻿ 
Your adjusted gross income (AGI) is important because it’s the total taxable income calculated before itemized or standard deductions, exemptions, and credits are taken into account.﻿﻿ It dictates how you can use various tax credits and exemptions. For example, AGI affects the amount of money you can claim for the child tax credit.﻿﻿
 
Your adjusted gross income is equal to your gross income, less certain tax-deductible expenses, including:
 You can do the math to figure out your AGI, or you can find it on line 8b of Form 1040.﻿﻿ 
To find your MAGI, take your AGI and add back:
 Many of these deductions are not commonly used, so your MAGI and AGI could be similar or even identical.﻿﻿ 
To contribute to a Roth IRA, your MAGI must be below the limits specified by the IRS. If you’re within the income threshold, the actual amount you can contribute is also determined by your MAGI. If your MAGI exceeds the allowed limits, your contributions are phased out.﻿﻿

Note that if you contribute more than you’re allowed, you have to remove the excess contributions. Otherwise, you’ll face a tax penalty. Excess contributions are taxed at a rate of 6% per year for as long as the excess amount remains in your IRA.﻿﻿
 
Your MAGI and whether you and your spouse have retirement plans at work determine if you can deduct traditional IRA contributions. If neither spouse is covered by a plan at work, you can take the full deduction, up to the amount of your contribution limit. However, if either spouse has a plan at work, your deduction could be limited.﻿﻿
