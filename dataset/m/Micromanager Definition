A micromanager is a boss or manager who gives excessive supervision to employees. A micromanager, rather than telling an employee what task needs to be accomplished and by when will watch the employee's actions closely and provide frequent criticism of the employeeâ€™s work and processes.
 
Micromanagement is a form of leadership that may produce results in the short-term, but it hurts employee and company morale over time.

Macro managers have confidence that the team can complete the same task without being continually reminded of the process.
