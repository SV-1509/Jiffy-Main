A deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) is an employer-sponsored Canadian profit sharing plan that is registered with the Canadian Revenue Agency, which is basically the Canadian version of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States.﻿﻿
 
DPSPs are a type of pension fund. On a periodic basis, the employer shares the profits made from the business with all employees or a designated group of employees through the DPSP. Employees who receive a share of the profits paid out by the employer do not have to pay federal taxes on the money received from the DPSP until it is withdrawn.﻿﻿
 
An employer that chooses to participate in a DPSP with some or all of its employees is referred to as the sponsor of the plan. Employees who are granted a share of the profits have these funds managed by a trustee of the plan. Employees who participate in a deferred profit sharing plan see their contributions grow tax-free, which can lead to bigger investment gains over time, due to the compounding effect. They can access the funds prior to retirement; funds may be withdrawn partly or in their entirety within the first two years of membership. Taxes are then paid upon withdrawal.﻿﻿
 
For employers, a deferred profit sharing plan paired with a group retirement savings plan can be a cheaper alternative to a defined-contribution plan. Some of the positive attributes of DPSPs include:
