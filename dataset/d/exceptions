Debt/EBITDA—earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization—is a ratio measuring the amount of income generated and available to pay down debt before covering interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses. Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.
 
Banks often include a certain debt/EBITDA target in the covenants for business loans, and a company must maintain this agreed-upon level or risk having the entire loan become due immediately. This metric is commonly used by credit rating agencies to assess a company's probability of defaulting on issued debt, and firms with a high debt/EBITDA ratio may not be able to service their debt in an appropriate manner, leading to a lowered credit rating.

where:
 
Debt = Long-term and short-term debt obligations
 
EBITDA = Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
 
To determine the debt/EBITDA ratio, add the company's long-term and short-term debt obligations. You can find these numbers in the company's quarterly and annual financial statements. Divide this by the company's EBITDA. You can calculate EBITDA using data from the company's income statement. The standard method to calculate EBITDA is to start with operating profit, also called earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and then add back depreciation and amortization.
 
The debt/EBITDA ratio is similar to the net debt/EBITDA ratio. The main difference is the net debt/EBITDA ratio subtracts cash and cash equivalents while the standard ratio does not.
 
The debt/EBITDA ratio compares a company's total obligations, including debt and other liabilities, to the actual cash the company brings in and reveals how capable the firm is of paying its debt and other liabilities.
 
When lenders and analysts look at a company's debt/EBITDA ratio, they want to know how well the firm can cover its debts. EBITDA represents a company's earnings or income, and it's an acronym for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It's calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses to net income.
 
Analysts often look at EBITDA as a more accurate measure of earnings from the firm's operations, rather than net income. Some analysts see interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization as an impediment to real cash flows. In other words, they see EBITDA as a cleaner representation of the real cash flows available to pay off debt.
 
Analysts like the debt/EBITDA ratio because it is easy to calculate. Debt can be found on the balance sheet and EBITDA can be calculated from the income statement. The issue, however, is that it may not provide the most accurate measure of earnings. More than earnings, analysts want to gauge the amount of actual cash available for debt repayment.
 
Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that do not really impact cash flows, but interest on debt can be a significant expense for some companies. Banks and investors looking at the current debt/EBITDA ratio to gain insight on how well the company can pay for its debt may want to consider the impact of interest on debt-repayment ability, even if that debt will be included in new issuance. For this reason, net income minus capital expenditures, plus depreciation and amortization may be the better measure of cash available for debt repayment.
 
As an example, if company A has $100 million in debt and $10 million in EBITDA, the debt/EBITDA ratio is 10. If company A pays off 50% of that debt in the next five years, while increasing EBITDA to $25 million, the debt/EBITDA ratio falls to two.
 
A declining debt/EBITDA ratio is better than an increasing one because it implies the company is paying off its debt and/or growing earnings. Likewise, an increasing debt/EBITDA ratio means the company is increasing debt more than earnings.
 
Some industries are more capital intensive than others, so a company's debt/EBITDA ratio should only be compared to the same ratio for other companies in the same industry. In some industries, a debt/EBITDA of 10 could be completely normal, while in other industries a ratio of three to four is more appropriate.

A debt/equity swap is a transaction in which the obligations or debts of a company or individual are exchanged for something of value, namely, equity. In the case of a publicly-traded company, this generally entails an exchange of bonds for stock. The value of the stocks and bonds being exchanged is typically determined by the market at the time of the swap.
 
A debt/equity swap is a refinancing deal in which a debt holder gets an equity position in exchange for the cancellation of the debt. The swap is generally done to help a struggling company continue to operate. The logic behind this is an insolvent company cannot pay its debts or improve its equity standing. However, sometimes a company may simply wish to take advantage of favorable market conditions. Covenants in the bond indenture may prevent a swap from happening without consent.
 
In cases of bankruptcy, the debt holder does not have a choice about whether he wants to make the debt/equity swap. However, in other cases, he may have a choice in the matter. To entice people into debt/equity swaps, businesses often offer advantageous trade ratios. For example, if the business offers a 1:1 swap ratio, the bondholder receives stocks worth exactly the same amount as his bonds, not a particularly advantageous trade. However, if the company offers a 1:2 ratio, the bondholder receives stocks valued at twice as much as his bonds, making the trade more enticing.
 
Debt/equity swaps can offer debt holders equity because the business does not want to or cannot pay the face value of the bonds it has issued. To delay repayment, it offers stock instead.
 
In other cases, businesses have to maintain certain debt/equity ratios and invite debt holders to swap their debts for equity if the company helps to adjust that balance. These debt/equity ratios are often part of financing requirements imposed by lenders. In other cases, businesses use debt/equity swaps as part of their bankruptcy restructuring.
 
If a company decides to declare bankruptcy, it has a choice between Chapter 7 and Chapter 11. Under Chapter 7, all of the business's debts are eliminated, and the business no longer operates. Under Chapter 11, the business continues its operations while restructuring its finances. In many cases, Chapter 11 reorganization cancels the company's existing equity shares. It then reissues new shares to the debt holders, and the bondholders and creditors become the new shareholders in the company.
 
An equity/debt swap is the opposite of a debt/equity swap. Instead of trading debt for equity, shareholders swap equity for debt. Essentially, they exchange stocks for bonds. Generally, Equity/Debt swaps are conducted in order to facilitate smooth mergers or restructuring in a company.
 
Suppose company ABC has a $100 million debt that it is unable to service. The company offers 25% percent ownership to its two debtors in exchange for writing off the entire debt amount. This is a debt-for-equity swap in which the company has exchanged its debt holdings for equity ownership by two lenders.

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. These numbers are available on the balance sheet of a company’s financial statements.
 
The ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage. The D/E ratio is an important metric used in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly-owned funds. More specifically, it reflects the ability of shareholder equity to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn.
 
The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio.
 
﻿Debt/Equity=Total LiabilitiesTotal Shareholders’ Equity\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \text{Total Liabilities} }{ \text{Total Shareholders' Equity} } \\ \end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=Total Shareholders’ EquityTotal Liabilities​​﻿
 
The information needed for the D/E ratio is on a company's balance sheet. The balance sheet requires total shareholder equity to equal assets minus liabilities, which is a rearranged version of the balance sheet equation:
 
﻿Assets=Liabilities+Shareholder Equity\begin{aligned} &\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Shareholder Equity} \\ \end{aligned}​Assets=Liabilities+Shareholder Equity​﻿
 
These balance sheet categories may contain individual accounts that would not normally be considered “debt” or “equity” in the traditional sense of a loan or the book value of an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by retained earnings/losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand a company’s true leverage.
 
Because of the ambiguity of some of the accounts in the primary balance sheet categories, analysts and investors will often modify the D/E ratio to be more useful and easier to compare between different stocks. Analysis of the D/E ratio can also be improved by including short-term leverage ratios, profit performance, and growth expectations.
 
Business owners use a variety of software to track D/E ratios and other financial metrics. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as D/E ratio and debt ratio.﻿﻿ However, even the amateur trader may want to calculate a company's D/E ratio when evaluating a potential investment opportunity, and it can be calculated without the aid of templates.
 
Given that the debt-to-equity ratio measures a company’s debt relative to the value of its net assets, it is most often used to gauge the extent to which a company is taking on debt as a means of leveraging its assets. A high debt/equity ratio is often associated with high risk; it means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt.
 
If a lot of debt is used to finance growth, a company could potentially generate more earnings than it would have without that financing. If leverage increases earnings by a greater amount than the debt’s cost (interest), then shareholders should expect to benefit. However, if the cost of debt financing outweighs the increased income generated, share values may decline. The cost of debt can vary with market conditions. Thus, unprofitable borrowing may not be apparent at first.
 
Changes in long-term debt and assets tend to have the greatest impact on the D/E ratio because they tend to be larger accounts compared to short-term debt and short-term assets. If investors want to evaluate a company’s short-term leverage and its ability to meet debt obligations that must be paid over a year or less, other ratios will be used.
 
For example, an investor who needs to compare a company’s short-term liquidity or solvency will use the cash ratio:
 
﻿Cash Ratio=Cash+Marketable SecuritiesShort-Term Liabilities \begin{aligned} &\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{ \text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} }{ \text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\ \end{aligned}​Cash Ratio=Short-Term Liabilities Cash+Marketable Securities​​﻿
 
or the current ratio:
 
﻿Current Ratio=Short-Term AssetsShort-Term Liabilities \begin{aligned} &\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{ \text{Short-Term Assets} }{ \text{Short-Term Liabilities } } \\ \end{aligned}​Current Ratio=Short-Term Liabilities Short-Term Assets​​﻿
 
instead of a long-term measure of leverage like the D/E ratio.
 
The shareholders' equity portion of the balance sheet is equal to the total value of assets minus liabilities, but that isn’t the same thing as assets minus the debt associated with those assets. A common approach to resolving this issue is to modify the debt-to-equity ratio into the long-term debt-to-equity ratio. An approach like this helps an analyst focus on important risks.
 
Short-term debt is still part of the overall leverage of a company, but because these liabilities will be paid in a year or less, they aren’t as risky. For example, imagine a company with $1 million in short-term payables (wages, accounts payable, and notes, etc.) and $500,000 of long-term debt compared to a company with $500,000 in short-term payables and $1 million in long term debt. If both companies have $1.5 million in shareholder equity then they both have a D/E ratio of 1.00. On the surface, the risk from leverage is identical, but in reality, the second company is riskier.
 
As a rule, short-term debt tends to be cheaper than long-term debt and it is less sensitive to shifting interest rates; the second company’s interest expense and cost of capital is higher. If interest rates fall, long-term debt will need to be refinanced which can further increase costs. Rising interest rates would seem to favor the company with more long-term debt, but if the debt can be redeemed by bondholders it could still be a disadvantage.
 
The debt-to-equity ratio can be applied to personal financial statements as well, in which case it is also known as the personal debt-to-equity ratio. Here, “equity” refers to the difference between the total value of an individual’s assets and the total value of his/her debt or liabilities. The formula for the personal D/E ratio is represented as:
 
﻿Debt/Equity=Total Personal LiabilitiesPersonal Assets−Liabilities\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \text{Total Personal Liabilities} }{ \text{Personal Assets} - \text{Liabilities} } \\ \end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=Personal Assets−LiabilitiesTotal Personal Liabilities​​﻿
 
The personal debt/equity ratio is often used when an individual or small business is applying for a loan. Lenders use the D/E to evaluate how likely it would be that the borrower is able to continue making loan payments if their income was temporarily disrupted.
 
For example, a prospective mortgage borrower is likely to be able to continue making payments if they have more assets than debt if they were to be out of a job for a few months. This is also true for an individual applying for a small business loan or line of credit. If the business owner has a good personal debt/equity ratio, it is more likely that they can continue making loan payments while their business is growing.
 
Gearing ratios constitute a broad category of financial ratios, of which the debt-to-equity ratio is the best example. "Gearing" simply refers to financial leverage. Gearing ratios focus more heavily on the concept of leverage than other ratios used in accounting or investment analysis. This conceptual focus prevents gearing ratios from being precisely calculated or interpreted with uniformity. The underlying principle generally assumes that some leverage is good, but too much places an organization at risk.
 
At a fundamental level, gearing is sometimes differentiated from leverage. Leverage refers to the amount of debt incurred for the purpose of investing and obtaining a higher return, while gearing refers to debt along with total equity—or an expression of the percentage of company funding through borrowing. This difference is embodied in the difference between the debt ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio.
 The real use of debt/equity is comparing the ratio for firms in the same industry—if a company's ratio varies significantly from its competitors, that could raise a red flag. 
When using the debt/equity ratio, it is very important to consider the industry within which the company exists. Because different industries have different capital needs and growth rates, a relatively high D/E ratio may be common in one industry, meanwhile, a relatively low D/E may be common in another. For example, capital-intensive industries such as auto manufacturing tend to have a debt/equity ratio of over 1, while tech firms could have a typical debt/equity ratio around 0.5.﻿﻿
 
Utility stocks often have a very high D/E ratio compared to market averages. A utility grows slowly but is usually able to maintain a steady income stream, which allows these companies to borrow very cheaply. High leverage ratios in slow growth industries with stable income represent an efficient use of capital. The consumer staples or consumer non-cyclical sector tends to also have a high debt to equity ratio because these companies can borrow cheaply and have a relatively stable income.﻿﻿
 
Analysts are not always consistent about what is defined as debt. For example, preferred stock is sometimes considered equity, but the preferred dividend, par value, and liquidation rights make this kind of equity look a lot more like debt. Including preferred stock in total debt will increase the D/E ratio and make a company look riskier. Including preferred stock in the equity portion of the D/E ratio will increase the denominator and lower the ratio. It can be a big issue for companies like real estate investment trusts when preferred stock is included in the D/E ratio.
 
At the end of 2017, Apache Corp (APA) had total liabilities of $13.1 billion, total shareholder equity of $8.79 billion, and a debt/equity ratio of 1.49.﻿﻿ ConocoPhillips (COP) had total liabilities of $42.56 billion, total shareholder equity of $30.8 billion, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.38 at the end of 2017:﻿﻿
 
﻿APA=$13.1$8.79=1.49\begin{aligned} &\text{APA} = \frac{ \$13.1 }{ \$8.79 } = 1.49 \\ \end{aligned}​APA=$8.79$13.1​=1.49​﻿
 
﻿COP=$42.56$30.80=1.38\begin{aligned} &\text{COP} = \frac{ \$42.56 }{ \$30.80 } = 1.38 \\ \end{aligned}​COP=$30.80$42.56​=1.38​﻿
 
On the surface, it appears that APA’s higher leverage ratio indicates higher risk. However, this may be too generalized to be helpful at this stage and further investigation would be needed.
 
We can also see how reclassifying preferred equity can change the D/E ratio in the following example, where it is assumed a company has $500,000 in preferred stock, $1 million in total debt (excluding preferred stock), and $1.2 million in total shareholder equity (excluding preferred stock).
 
The debt-to-equity ratio with preferred stock as part of total liabilities would be as follows:
 
﻿Debt/Equity=$1 million+$500,000$1.25 million=1.25\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \$1 \text{ million} + \$500,000 }{ \$1.25 \text{ million} } = 1.25 \\ \end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=$1.25 million$1 million+$500,000​=1.25​﻿
 
The debt-to-equity ratio with preferred stock as part of shareholder equity would be:
 
﻿Debt/Equity=$1 million$1.25 million+$500,000=.57\begin{aligned} &\text{Debt/Equity} = \frac{ \$1 \text{ million} }{ \$1.25 \text{ million} + \$500,000 } = .57 \\ \end{aligned}​Debt/Equity=$1.25 million+$500,000$1 million​=.57​﻿
 
Other financial accounts, such as unearned income, will be classified as debt and can distort the D/E ratio. Imagine a company with a prepaid contract to construct a building for $1 million. The work is not complete, so the $1 million is considered a liability.
 
Assume that the company has purchased $500,000 of inventory and materials to complete the job that has increased total assets and shareholder equity. If these amounts are included in the D/E calculation, the numerator will be increased by $1 million and the denominator by $500,000, which will increase the ratio.

Deposit/withdrawal at custodian (DWAC) is a method of electronically transferring new shares or paper share certificates to and from the Depository Trust Company (DTC) using a Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) service transfer agent as the distribution point. The DWAC is one of two ways of transferring between broker/dealers and the DTC, the other being the Direct Registry System (DRS) method. Both enable investors to hold securities in registered form on the books of the transfer agent, rather than in physical form. DRS is different from DWAC in that shares in DRS have already been issued and are held electronically on the books of the transfer agent.
 
The DWAC process offers a number of benefits to investors, including time, cost savings, and lower risk.
 
As an electronic system, DWAC allows for immediate transfer to a brokerage account. There is no time needed for physical delivery so the settlement process is made more efficient and significantly accelerated. It also saves on costs associated with printing a physical certificate and mailing it.
 
Because there are no physical certificates transferred, there is no risk of loss or damage when transporting and handling such certificates.
 
While not typically a concern of investors, there are several requirements for the DWAC. Shares must be free trading or eligible for restriction removal. The broker must be a DTC participant and the issuer must be DWAC eligible.
 
The Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program (FAST) is a contract between DTC and transfer agents whereby FAST agents act as custodians for DTC. It eliminates the movement of physical securities.
 
The FAST program facilitates the industry’s dematerialization efforts and plays a significant role in reducing the costs associated with shipping certificates to and from agents as well as those related to printing and processing certificates. The FAST program does not apply to money market securities.
 
While this process is electronic, shareholders can still withdraw their stock from their brokerage accounts and request a physical stock certificate by either having the broker initiate the request through DTC or by having their broker send the shares electronically directly to the transfer agent through the DWAC system. There may be fees for this service. The withdrawal of DWAC shares as physical certificates generally require Medallion Signature Guarantee - a certification stamp that guarantees the signature on a share certificate is authentic.
 
Shareholders can deposit their stock into a brokerage account by either sending their physical stock certificate to their broker or by having the transfer agent send the shares directly to the broker through the DWAC system.
 
To deposit your shares to your broker via DWAC, shareholders must provide original stock certificate(s), the DWAC deposit form, and applicable fees.
